### Answer key – Equine Recurrent Uveitis (ERU)

1. **B** – ERU is a chronic, recurrent inflammation of the uveal tract leading to progressive ocular damage. It is not a single acute corneal event (A), a purely degenerative retinal disease (C), or a lens-luxation disorder (D).
2. **B** – The uveal tract comprises the iris, ciliary body, and choroid, all of which can be inflamed in ERU. Cornea/lens (A), retina/optic nerve (C), and conjunctiva/eyelids (D) belong to other ocular structures.
3. **B** – ERU is commonly known as “moon blindness,” historically associated with periodic recurrences. “Night blindness” (A), “rain scald” (C), and “lockjaw” (D) are unrelated conditions.
4. **B** – ERU is the leading cause of blindness in horses due to cumulative inflammatory damage. It is more than mild keratoconjunctivitis (A), not a canine disease (C), and certainly not self-limiting without risk (D).
5. **B** – ERU is an immune-mediated disease characterized by breakdown of ocular immune privilege and autoantibody-mediated attack on eye tissues, often triggered by infection or trauma. Pure trauma (A), primary bacterial conjunctivitis (C), and vitamin A deficiency (D) do not explain its recurrent, immune nature.
6. **A** – *Leptospira interrogans* is the infectious agent most commonly implicated as a trigger or contributor to ERU. *Streptococcus equi* (B), EHV-1 (C), and *Borrelia* (D) are associated with other syndromes.
7. **B** – Appaloosas have the highest genetic risk for ERU, with a significantly increased incidence compared to other breeds. Thoroughbreds (A), Arabians (C), and Standardbreds (D) do not show the same level of predisposition.
8. **B** – ERU can affect any age, but is often seen in young to middle-aged horses. It is not confined to neonates (A), very old horses (C), or yearlings only (D).
9. **A** – Acute ERU presents with squinting, epiphora (tearing), photophobia, a cloudy cornea, and miosis from ciliary spasm and uveitis. The other options describe different ocular problems or lack of pain.
10. **B** – Chronic ERU is associated with cataracts, posterior or anterior synechiae, retinal degeneration/damage, and vitreous opacities (“snow globe” effect) as sequelae of repeated flares. Pure conjunctivitis (C) or sudden perforation (D) are not hallmark chronic findings.
11. **B** – ERU predisposes to cataract formation, secondary glaucoma, retinal detachment, and eventual phthisis bulbi (shrunken eye). KCS/entropion (A), corneal sequestra (C), and congenital malformations (D) are different entities.
12. **B** – The classic pattern is recurrent episodes of painful uveitis with intervals of relative quiescence but progressive structural damage and vision loss. A single mild conjunctivitis (A), nasal discharge (C), or head shaking alone (D) are not characteristic.
13. **A** – Leptospira serology or other specific tests can help identify prior or active infection associated with ERU. Fecal exams (B), joint fluid (C), and bile acids (D) target other organ systems.
14. **B** – Corneal ulceration must always be ruled out because steroids are contraindicated when the cornea is ulcerated. Gastric ulcers (A), colic (C), and navicular disease (D) do not mimic a painful, cloudy eye.
15. **B** – Corticosteroids (topical or systemic) are key to reducing intraocular inflammation in ERU but must only be used when no corneal ulcer is present. They are not absolutely contraindicated (A), not just systemic infection treatments (C), and not fully replaced by antibiotics (D).
16. **B** – Atropine dilates the pupil, relieves ciliary muscle spasm, helps prevent synechiae, and reduces pain in uveitis. It does not constrict the pupil (A), kill leptospires (C), or primarily increase tears (D).
17. **A** – Flunixin meglumine and phenylbutazone are typical NSAIDs used to control pain and inflammation in ERU. Aspirin/acetaminophen (B) and sedatives (C, D) do not serve as standard primary NSAIDs.
18. **B** – Long-term options to reduce recurrence and manage chronic ERU include cyclosporine implants and vitrectomy in selected cases. Corneal transplants (A), blanket early enucleation (C), and simple bandage lenses (D) are not typical long-term disease-modifying strategies.
19. **C** – Enucleation is reserved for blind, painful eyes where further medical or surgical therapy cannot restore vision and the eye is a source of chronic pain. It is not appropriate at the first mild flare (A), when vision is normal (B), or never indicated (D).
20. **B** – Prognosis depends on early, aggressive management: vision may be maintained, but frequent recurrences can still lead to blindness, and lifelong monitoring/treatment are often required. ERU is neither cured with a single treatment (A), nor always non-progressive (C, D).
