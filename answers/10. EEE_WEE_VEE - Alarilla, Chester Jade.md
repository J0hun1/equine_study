### Answer key – EEE, WEE, and VEE Equine Encephalitides

1. **B** – EEE, WEE, and VEE are arboviral encephalomyelitides that affect horses and humans, causing inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. They are not pneumonias (A), fungal meningitis (C), or protozoal myeloencephalitis of ruminants (D).
2. **B** – These viruses belong to the family Togaviridae and genus Alphavirus. Orthomyxoviridae/Influenzavirus (A), Flaviviridae/Flavivirus (C), and Rhabdoviridae/Lyssavirus (D) refer to other pathogens.
3. **B** – The viruses are transmitted via mosquitoes from sylvatic reservoirs (birds or rodents) to horses and humans. Direct contact (A), fecal-oral (C), or aerosol (D) routes are not the primary modes.
4. **A** – Birds are the primary reservoirs for EEEV, whereas rodents serve as reservoirs for endemic VEEV strains. Horses are usually dead-end hosts except for epizootic VEEV (B), and other listed animals (C, D) are not the main reservoirs.
5. **C** – VEEV can mutate such that horses become amplifying hosts, with high viremia capable of infecting mosquitoes and then humans, creating a significant zoonotic risk in epizootics. EEEV and WEEV (A, B) maintain horses mostly as dead-end hosts.
6. **A** – EEEV is the most neurovirulent and rapidly destructive, with very high mortality. WEEV and VEEV (B, C) are serious but generally less virulent than EEEV; WNV (D) is a flavivirus with different characteristics.
7. **B** – These viruses are endemic in North and South America. They are not primarily European/Asian (A), exclusively African (C), or Australian/New Zealand (D) diseases.
8. **B** – Young, under-vaccinated horses in endemic regions with high mosquito density are at higher risk, especially for EEE. Geriatric horses (A), only drafts in cold climates (C), or only breeding stallions (D) are not the primary risk groups.
9. **B** – The prodromal stage often features fever, depression, inappetence, and sometimes mild lameness or abdominal discomfort before neurologic signs develop. Severe colic/diarrhea (A), respiratory-only signs (C), or no signs (D) do not fit the typical prodrome.
10. **A** – Neurologic signs include somnolence, dementia, head pressing, ataxia, blindness, circling, seizures, and sometimes weakness or paralysis from diffuse brain (and sometimes spinal cord) involvement. Pruritus (B), pure respiratory signs (C), or isolated laminitis (D) are atypical.
11. **A** – Severe disease can progress to colic-like signs, reduced alertness, recumbency, and death. Solely dermatologic (B), laminitic (C), or ocular discharge (D) signs are not typical of terminal encephalitis.
12. **A** – An IgM capture ELISA titer ≥400 or a fourfold rise in titer between acute and convalescent sera supports recent infection. Stable low IgG (B), negative IgM (C), or fecal PCR (D) do not confirm infection in this context.
13. **B** – An EEEV:WEEV titer ratio ≥4 is suspicious and ≥8 is strongly indicative of EEEV infection. A ratio ≤1 (A), exactly 2 (C), or disregarding titers (D) are incorrect.
14. **B** – CSF findings typically show neutrophilic pleocytosis with elevated total protein, reflecting inflammation of the CNS. Eosinophilic (A) or purely lymphocytic with low protein (D) patterns suggest other etiologies, and normal CSF (C) is less consistent with active encephalitis.
15. **A** – West Nile virus encephalomyelitis is a major differential because it also causes viral encephalitis with overlapping clinical signs, although it often affects the spinal cord more prominently. Influenza (B), strangles (C), and sarcoids (D) involve different systems.
16. **A** – Other important differentials include rabies, leukoencephalomalacia (from moldy corn), and hepatic encephalopathy, all of which can cause acute neurologic signs. Laminitis/colic (B), navicular (C), and ulcers (D) are not primarily neurologic.
17. **B** – There is no specific antiviral therapy; treatment is supportive with fluids, metabolic support, prevention of self-trauma, and sometimes corticosteroids in selected cases. Specific antivirals (A) and antibiotics alone (C) or NSAIDs alone (D) are insufficient.
18. **B** – Reported mortality: EEEV 85–100%, WEEV ~20–40%, and VEEV ~40–80%. The other figures (A, C, D) do not match the known pattern.
19. **B** – Vaccination is the main preventive tool, reducing incidence and severity and forming the basis of control programs in endemic areas. It does not eliminate mosquitoes (A), cure infection (C), or only protect humans (D).
20. **B** – EEEV and WEEV make horses dead-end hosts (no significant viremia), whereas VEEV can create high viremia in horses, making them amplifying hosts and increasing zoonotic risk. All three do not amplify equally (A), and they clearly have zoonotic potential (C, D being incorrect).
