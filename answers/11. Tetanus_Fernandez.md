### Answer key – Tetanus

1. **B** – Tetanus is a bacterial disease caused by *Clostridium tetani* in necrotic tissue, producing a neurotoxin that results in muscular spasms. It is not viral (A), fungal (C), or protozoal GI disease (D).
2. **B** – Horses are among the most sensitive species to tetanus toxin, which is why vaccination and prompt wound care are so critical. They are neither resistant (A) nor unaffected (C), and risk is not limited to foals (D).
3. **B** – *C. tetani* is an anaerobic, Gram-positive, spore-forming bacillus with terminal spherical spores found in soil and feces. The other descriptions (A, C, D) fit different organisms.
4. **B** – The organism gains access via contaminated wounds where low oxygen tension permits spore germination and toxin production. Inhalation (A), vertical transmission (C), and gastric colonization (D) are not typical routes.
5. **B** – An anaerobic environment caused by necrosis, foreign material, or mixed infection favors germination and growth of *C. tetani* in the wound. Highly oxygenated (A), intact (C), or sun-exposed (D) sites are less conducive.
6. **B** – Tetanospasmin is the main neurotoxin responsible for clinical signs; tetanolysin (A) contributes to local necrosis, while botulinum toxin (C) is from *C. botulinum*.
7. **B** – Tetanospasmin travels to the CNS and cleaves synaptobrevin in presynaptic inhibitory interneurons, blocking glycine and GABA release and disinhibiting motor neurons. Blocking acetylcholine (A) describes botulism, not tetanus.
8. **B** – The loss of inhibitory input leads to hypertonia and generalized muscular spasms, producing the classic “stiff” horse. Flaccid paralysis (A), isolated sensory neuropathy (C), or demyelination (D) are not typical.
9. **A** – Tetanolysin promotes local tissue necrosis, furthering anaerobic conditions and bacterial proliferation. The other toxins (B–D) are produced by different bacteria.
10. **B** – The incubation period is usually 1–3 weeks but can vary widely, consistent with spore germination and toxin spread. Hours (A), many months (C), or years (D) are incorrect.
11. **B** – Unvaccinated horses with contaminated soft tissue or penetrating foot wounds are at greatest risk, though vaccinated horses can rarely be affected. Horses with no wounds (C) or only foals with diarrhea (D) are not the main risk groups.
12. **B** – Early signs include history of a wound, local stiffness, lameness, colic-like discomfort, and progression to a stiff, spastic gait. Isolated ocular or respiratory signs (A, C) and pruritus (D) are not typical first signs.
13. **A** – Classic overt signs include “sawhorse stance,” raised tail head, flared nostrils, erect ears, third eyelid prolapse, and lockjaw due to masseter spasm. The other answer choices (B–D) are incomplete or incorrect.
14. **B** – Progressive tetanus causes dysphagia, saliva accumulation, aspiration risk, hyperthermia, profuse sweating, recumbency, severe extensor rigidity, difficulty urinating/defecating, and respiratory failure. Hypothermia (A), mild lethargy (C), and isolated colic (D) do not summarize advanced disease.
15. **A** – Differential diagnoses include laminitis, hypocalcemia, rhabdomyolysis, rabies, and myotonia, which can mimic some neuromuscular aspects. Colic, navicular, and asthma (B–D) are less comparable.
16. **B** – Initial treatment focuses on neutralizing unbound toxin with tetanus antitoxin, eliminating the infection via wound debridement and antimicrobials, and providing intensive nursing care. Steroids alone (A), antifungals (C), or limb amputation (D) are not appropriate primary strategies.
17. **B** – Nursing care requires a quiet, dark environment, deep bedding, minimal stimulation, padded surroundings, and frequent repositioning or slinging of recumbent horses. Bright/noisy environments (A), forced exercise (C), and fluid restriction (D) increase risk.
18. **A** – Penicillin G IV (22,000–44,000 IU/kg q6h for 7–10 days) is a standard choice for killing vegetative *C. tetani*. Acyclovir (B), fluconazole (C), and praziquantel (D) target viruses, fungi, and parasites respectively.
19. **B** – TAT contains antibodies that can bind and neutralize tetanus toxoid antigen if both are injected at the same site, reducing vaccine effectiveness, so separate sites are recommended. Local irritation (A), hepatotoxicity (C), and “better absorption” (D) are not the main reasons.
20. **B** – Prognosis is guarded to poor, with reported mortality of 50–80%; recumbent horses unable to rise fare worst, while standing horses with good care can recover over weeks. It is neither uniformly benign (A, D) nor universally fatal within 24 hours (C).
