### Answer key – Osteoarthritis (OA)

1. **B** – OA is a chronic, progressive, noninfectious deterioration of articular cartilage with associated joint changes. It is not primarily infectious (A), purely developmental (C), or a systemic autoimmune disease (D) in horses.
2. **B** – OA features cartilage loss, subchondral bone sclerosis, osteophyte formation, and synovial membrane inflammation. Synovial effusion alone (A), pure tendon rupture (C), or congenital ankylosis (D) do not define OA.
3. **B** – Athletic horses of all ages and both sexes, especially those in repetitive, high-load work, are predisposed, though any horse can develop OA. It is not restricted to geriatric pasture pets (A), foals (C), or stallions (D).
4. **A** – OA commonly follows joint instability, trauma, abnormal biomechanical stress, poor conformation, repetitive overuse, prior ligament/tendon/cartilage injury, infectious arthritis, or osteochondrosis. Simple vitamin deficiency (B), laminitis alone (C), or seasonal changes (D) are not the main drivers.
5. **A** – Synovitis produces mediators like PGE₂, IL‑1, TNF‑α, and MMPs that degrade cartilage matrix and reduce synovial fluid quality, accelerating OA. Direct infection (B) and purely mechanical wear (C) are incomplete explanations.
6. **B** – In OA, synovial fluid becomes less viscous and hyaluronic acid concentration decreases, impairing lubrication and shock absorption. Increased viscosity (A), pus (C), or no change (D) are incorrect.
7. **B** – Subchondral bone becomes sclerotic and less compliant, altering load distribution and encouraging osteophyte formation; this further stresses cartilage. It does not soften (A), remain unaffected (C), or simply liquefy (D).
8. **A** – The hallmark is articular cartilage degeneration; pain arises from innervated periarticular tissues and subchondral bone rather than cartilage itself. Pure synovial infection (B), ligament rupture (C), or bone tumors (D) describe other conditions.
9. **B** – A history of intra-articular injury (fracture, ligament damage, osteochondrosis) plus insidious lameness in low-motion joints or acute lameness in high-motion joints suggests OA. Neurologic signs (A), respiratory disease (C), or skin problems (D) point elsewhere.
10. **B** – Examination often reveals variable lameness, pain on flexion, synovial effusion (especially in high-motion joints), reduced range of motion, stiffness after rest, joint capsule thickening, periarticular hardening, and crepitus. Colic (A), fever (C), and hindlimb paralysis (D) are not typical.
11. **A** – Radiography is the standard imaging tool, revealing joint space narrowing, osteophytes, periosteal bone proliferation, and subchondral sclerosis. CT (B) and other modalities are adjuncts, not first-line.
12. **A** – Arthroscopy allows direct visualization of cartilage and subchondral bone lesions and can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. MRI and scintigraphy (B, C) detect changes indirectly; “fecal imaging” (D) is facetious.
13. **B** – OA treatment aims to reduce inflammation and pain, restore or maintain cartilage homeostasis and joint mobility, and delay further degeneration. Eradicating bacteria (A) or increasing load (D) are not relevant goals.
14. **A** – Appropriate strategies include rest and controlled exercise, weight management, corrective shoeing, cold therapy, hydrotherapy, physiotherapy, and soft footing to reduce joint impact. Prolonged strict rest (B), hard-surface work (C), or unchanged training (D) can worsen outcomes.
15. **A** – Phenylbutazone and flunixin meglumine are commonly used equine NSAIDs for OA pain control. Human OTC analgesics (B) and sedatives/antivirals (C, D) are not mainstays.
16. **A** – HA restores synovial fluid viscosity and lubrication, while PSGAGs (e.g., Adequan) support cartilage matrix and may slow degradation. They are not cosmetic (B), osteophyte-destroying (C), or foal-only (D) agents.
17. **A** – Methylprednisolone acetate and triamcinolone acetate are commonly used; strict asepsis is essential, and repeated steroid use can soften cartilage and increase laminitis risk. Claims that no precautions are needed (B, C) or that corticosteroids are never used (D) are incorrect.
18. **A** – Systemic HA/PSGAG and autologous biologics (IRAP, PRP, ACS) can reduce inflammatory mediators and help protect cartilage. Vitamins (B), antibiotics (C), and anthelmintics (D) do not specifically target OA pathophysiology.
19. **B** – Corticosteroids should be used judiciously, balancing pain relief with the risk of cartilage damage and laminitis, and injections must be performed aseptically; monitoring for septic arthritis and “joint flares” is essential. Overuse (A) and lack of reassessment (D) are unsafe.
20. **A** – Mild OA in low-motion joints often has a good prognosis with early, appropriate management, while severe OA in high-motion joints carries a guarded to poor prognosis for high-level performance; arthrodesis can restore comfort in some cases. Rapid ankylosis in all cases (B), no performance impact (C), or universally excellent prognosis (D) are not accurate.
