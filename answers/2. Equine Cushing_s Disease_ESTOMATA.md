### Answer key – Equine Cushing’s Disease (PPID)

1. **B** – Equine Cushing’s disease is more accurately termed pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID). EMS (A) is a different metabolic disorder, and primary adrenal (C) or thyroid (D) diseases are not the defining features here.
2. **C** – PPID is predominantly a disease of older horses, typically over 15 years of age, although it can occur earlier. It is not primarily a disease of foals (A), young adults (B), or restricted to a specific middle-aged draft population (D).
3. **B** – Up to about 30% of aged horses are thought to be affected by PPID, making it relatively common in geriatric populations. It is not rare (A), not restricted to ponies (C), and certainly not evenly distributed across all ages (D).
4. **B** – Ponies are often observed with PPID largely because they tend to live longer, so age-related degenerative conditions are more likely to appear. There is no unique pituitary anatomy (A) or clear evidence of greater trauma risk (C), and higher baseline ACTH in youth (D) is not the main explanation.
5. **B** – PPID involves overactivity of the pars intermedia due to loss of dopaminergic inhibition, leading to excessive hormone production. The pars distalis/TSH axis (A), adrenal underactivity (C), and thyroid destruction (D) are not the primary changes.
6. **C** – Degeneration of hypothalamic dopaminergic neurons that normally inhibit the pars intermedia leads to pituitary enlargement and hormone overproduction. Optic nerves (A), peripheral sympathetic nerves (B), and the phrenic nerve (D) are not primarily involved.
7. **C** – Excessive ACTH release from the overactive pars intermedia is a hallmark of PPID, driving abnormal cortisol dynamics. T4 (A), growth hormone (B), and aldosterone (D) are not the primary hormones implicated.
8. **B** – Common signs include laminitis, hirsutism, abnormal fat deposition and insulin resistance, polyuria/polydipsia, sweating, lethargy, neurologic signs, infertility, and increased susceptibility to infections. The other choices describe unrelated or incomplete presentations (A, C, D).
9. **B** – Hirsutism in PPID refers to the failure to shed the long, often curly winter coat, resulting in an abnormally long hair coat year-round. Complete hair loss (A), pigment changes (C), or hoof overgrowth (D) are different issues.
10. **B** – A baseline ACTH test is a simple blood test used to screen for PPID by measuring resting ACTH levels. Baseline T4 (A) is more relevant to thyroid function, insulin/glucose alone (C) are more for EMS, and dexamethasone suppression (D) is a different endocrine test.
11. **B** – The TRH stimulation test involves IV administration of TRH followed by measurement of ACTH at defined time points, comparing baseline and post-TRH values. The other options describe different hormones and protocols (A, C, D).
12. **C** – CT can visualize an enlarged pituitary but is expensive, technically challenging, and not usually necessary for diagnosis, so it is not typically an initial test. The pituitary can indeed be imaged (A, B), and laminitis (D) is not a formal contraindication to CT.
13. **B** – Pergolide is a dopamine agonist that mimics the action of dopamine on the pars intermedia, restoring inhibition and reducing excessive ACTH production. It does not stimulate ACTH (A), destroy cells directly (C), or block cortisol receptors peripherally (D).
14. **C** – A reversible loss of appetite is the most common early side effect when starting pergolide therapy, which is why gradual dose escalation is sometimes needed. Blindness (A), severe GI upset (B), and laminitis from drug toxicity (D) are not typical primary adverse effects.
15. **B** – Horses with PPID should avoid high-sugar diets; grain should contain <10% sugar and starch, and hay should be tested and adjusted (or soaked) to reduce nonstructural carbohydrates. High-sugar grain (A), lush pasture (C), and molasses-rich feeds (D) all increase laminitis risk.
16. **B** – Grass sugar content is highest in spring and fall, particularly under cool, sunny conditions, increasing the risk of laminitis in PPID horses, so grazing should be restricted. Protein (A), vitamins (C), or alkaloids (D) are not the primary concerns here.
17. **A** – Good management includes maintaining an ideal body weight, routine hoof and dental care, parasite control, and regular body clipping (to help with hirsutism and thermoregulation). Avoiding clipping (B), neglecting dental care (C), or infrequent hoof trimming (D) are inappropriate.
18. **B** – PPID is considered a natural degenerative condition of aging dopaminergic neurons; current knowledge suggests it cannot be fully prevented. While management can mitigate effects, diet and exercise alone do not prevent it (A), toxins (C) are not the sole cause, and there is no vaccine (D).
19. **B** – Early recognition and pergolide therapy may slow progression, reduce complications (e.g., laminitis, infections), and improve quality of life. It does not generally cure PPID (A), prevent all endocrine disease (C), or eliminate the need for hoof care (D).
20. **C** – PPID and EMS are distinct but can coexist in the same horse, complicating clinical management and laminitis risk. They are not identical (A), they can indeed occur together (contradicting B), and EMS is not confined to young horses (D).
