### Answer key – Tyzzer’s Disease

1. **B** – Tyzzer’s disease is an acute, rapidly progressive bacterial hepatitis in very young foals, often fatal. It is not chronic adult cholangitis (A), viral encephalitis (C), or parasitic enteritis (D).
2. **B** – The causative agent is *Clostridium piliforme* (formerly *Bacillus piliformis*). *C. tetani* (A), *Salmonella* (C), and *Rhodococcus* (D) cause different diseases.
3. **B** – *C. piliforme* is a spore-forming, gram-negative, obligate anaerobic, intracellular, filamentous rod. The other descriptions (A, C, D) fit different organisms.
4. **C** – Foals are infected via the fecal-oral route by ingesting contaminated soil or feces from adult horses or the environment. Transplacental (A), inhalation (B), and tick-borne routes (D) are not typical.
5. **B** – The classic age range is 7–42 days with an average around 20 days, reflecting susceptibility of very young foals. Neonates (A), older foals (C), and adults (D) are not the usual patients.
6. **B** – Clinical signs include loss of suckle, depression to recumbency, fever, tachypnea, tachycardia, icterus, petechiation, diarrhea, dehydration, shock, seizures, coma, or sudden death. Respiratory-only (A), chronic colic (C), or laminitis (D) do not characterize this disease.
7. **B** – Pathology mainly involves acute multifocal hepatitis, myocarditis, and enteritis. Kidney/spleen (A), CNS (C), or hoof/skin (D) are not the primary targets described.
8. **B** – Grossly, the liver is swollen with 1–5 mm white foci scattered through the parenchyma, and tissues are icteric with petechial hemorrhages. Fibrous nodules (A), gallstones (C), or black liver (D) are not typical.
9. **A** – Additional findings may include enterocolitis, myositis, pleural effusion, pulmonary congestion and edema, and lymphoid necrosis or depletion, reflecting multisystem involvement. Purely neurologic (B), renal-only (C), or gastric-only (D) lesions are not typical.
10. **B** – Histologic confirmation shows intracellular interlacing bundles of filamentous bacilli at lesion peripheries, highlighted by silver stains such as Warthin-Starry or Dieterle. Viral inclusions (A), fungal hyphae (C), or protozoal cysts (D) indicate other pathogens.
11. **B** – CBC commonly shows hemoconcentration and hyperfibrinogenemia with normal-to-low leukocyte counts, consistent with severe systemic disease and dehydration. The other patterns (A, C, D) do not match the description.
12. **A** – Typical biochemical changes include hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and marked elevations in liver enzymes (SDH, GGT, ALP, bilirubin). Hyperglycemia with normal liver values (B) or isolated hypocalcemia (C) are not characteristic.
13. **B** – Transmission is primarily fecal-oral from contaminated environmental sources. Milk (A), sexual (C), and insect-borne (D) routes are not major pathways.
14. **A** – Recommended antimicrobials include penicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole–trimethoprim, and metronidazole targeting Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. Macrolides alone (B), cephalosporins only (C), or antifungals (D) are incomplete or inappropriate.
15. **A** – Diazepam and midazolam are used to control seizures in affected foals. Phenylbutazone (B) and flunixin (C) are NSAIDs; omeprazole (D) is for gastric ulcers.
16. **B** – Lactulose helps reduce intestinal ammonia production and absorption, mitigating hepatic encephalopathy. Sucralfate (A), furosemide (C), and lidocaine (D) have other indications.
17. **B** – Barbiturates can worsen CNS depression and hepatic encephalopathy in foals with severe liver disease, so they must be used with great caution. They do treat seizures (A), but risk outweighs benefit in many cases; they do not universally cause laminitis (C) or inactivate antibiotics (D).
18. **A** – Important differentials include neonatal septicemia, neonatal isoerythrolysis, viral hepatitis, and toxic hepatopathies, which can also cause acute hepatic dysfunction and systemic illness. The other sets (B–D) are unrelated.
19. **B** – Prognosis is grave; most foals die within 24 hours of clinical onset despite therapy. It is not generally excellent (A), nor usually good with minimal treatment (C), and spontaneous recovery (D) is rare.
20. **B** – Reducing environmental contamination (e.g., good hygiene, limiting access to feces in foaling areas) may help lower infection risk. Fecal accumulation (A), cutting vaccines (C), and crowding (D) increase disease and transmission risks.
