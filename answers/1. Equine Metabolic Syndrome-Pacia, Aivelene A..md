### Answer key – Equine Metabolic Syndrome (Pacia)

1. **B** – EMS is a characteristic collection of clinical signs and clinicopathologic changes in equids that increases the risk of hyperinsulinemia‑associated laminitis (HAL). It is not a congenital deformity (A), primary pituitary disease (C), or an infectious process (D).
2. **B** – Insulin dysregulation (ID) is the core component of EMS, leading to hyperinsulinemia and laminitis risk. Hyperlipemia (A) can occur with severe feed restriction, while primary hypothyroidism (C) and hyponatremia (D) are not central to EMS.
3. **A** – EMS is most common in ponies and certain “easy‑keeper” breeds such as Saddlebreds, Tennessee Walking Horses, Paso Finos, Morgans, and Mustangs. Thoroughbreds and Standardbreds (B, D) are less frequently affected, and foals (C) are not the typical population.
4. **C** – Affected horses are often obese or overconditioned with regional adiposity, especially a cresty neck and fat at the tailhead. Emaciation (A) and cachexia (D) are the opposite of EMS, and normal body condition (B) does not reflect the typical phenotype.
5. **C** – EMS and PPID can occur concurrently in middle‑aged and older horses, and horses with one condition should be evaluated for the other. They clearly can coexist (contradicting A), PPID is not the only cause of laminitis (B), and PPID horses should indeed be checked for ID (D).
6. **C** – Hyperinsulinemia is the key mediator linking EMS to laminitis, with high insulin concentrations damaging laminar tissues. Bacterial toxins (A), direct fat compression of the hoof (B), and vitamin E deficiency (D) are not the primary mechanisms in EMS‑associated laminitis.
7. **B** – A classic EMS horse is overconditioned or obese with a cresty neck and regional fat deposits. Underweight horses (A) and cachectic horses (D) do not match this picture, and there is often a history or risk of laminitis rather than an entirely normal horse (B).
8. **B** – Abnormal hoof growth rings and radiographic evidence of third phalanx rotation or pedal osteitis are typical occult signs of prior laminitis in EMS. Petechiae (A), tendon swelling (C), and sole bruising alone (D) are not characteristic evidence of past laminitis episodes in EMS.
9. **B** – The main diagnostic objective is to document insulin dysregulation using appropriate endocrine tests (e.g., resting insulin, OST, OGT). Hypothyroidism (A) and pituitary imaging (C) are not primary goals, and bacteremia (D) is irrelevant in EMS.
10. **A** – Diet, pain, and stress significantly influence blood glucose and insulin concentrations, so testing must be done under controlled, low‑stress conditions for valid results. Stress does not mask EMS (B), and it clearly does affect endocrine tests (C, D).
11. **B** – In the OST, an insulin concentration ≥ 45 mIU/mL at 60–90 minutes after corn syrup administration is consistent with insulin dysregulation. Lower values (A, C, D) would not meet the described diagnostic threshold.
12. **A** – In the OGT, an insulin concentration ≥ 65 mIU/mL 2 hours after giving 0.75 g/kg dextrose mixed with chaff is consistent with ID. The other answer choices describe lower or non‑diagnostic responses (B–D).
13. **A** – A blood insulin concentration ≤ 50 mIU/mL indicates an acceptable response to management and a low risk of laminitis. Values between 50–100 mIU/mL (B) are equivocal, and ≥ 100 mIU/mL (C, D) indicate poor control and high risk.
14. **C** – A blood insulin concentration ≥ 100 mIU/mL signifies inadequate management and a high laminitis risk. Lower or borderline values (A, B, D) do not indicate the same level of concern.
15. **B** – Management focuses on eliminating grazing, grains, and treats and feeding low‑NSC hay divided into multiple small meals. Free‑choice pasture and grain (A) and high‑NSC feeding strategies (C, D) directly oppose recommended practice and increase laminitis risk.
16. **B** – For obese EMS horses, feeding low‑NSC hay at about 1.5% of body weight per day is recommended, avoiding overly severe restriction to reduce hyperlipemia risk. Extreme restriction (A), very high intake (C), or pasture‑only (D) are inappropriate.
17. **B** – Nonstructural carbohydrate intake should not exceed about 0.1 g/kg per meal to limit glycemic and insulinemic spikes. The other options either ignore restriction (A), recommend excessive NSC (C), or arbitrarily time restriction (D).
18. **C** – Regular hoof trimming every 4 weeks by an experienced farrier, along with radiographic monitoring, is recommended because HAL can occur without obvious lameness. Neglecting hoof care (A, B) or waiting for severe laminitis before intervening (D) is unsafe.
19. **C** – After laminitis resolution, appropriate exercise helps improve insulin sensitivity by building muscle and reducing fat mass, and is an important part of EMS management. Permanent rest (A), minimal activity (B), or ignoring the metabolic benefits of exercise (D) are not supported.
20. **C** – Prevention emphasizes an appropriate, individualized diet, maintaining normal body condition, and strict grazing restriction during times of high soluble carbohydrate (spring and autumn), especially in high‑risk breeds. High‑NSC diets (A), generic feeding without regard to condition (B), and unrestricted pasture during risky seasons (D) all increase EMS and laminitis risk.
