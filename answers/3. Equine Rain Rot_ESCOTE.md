### Answer key – Equine Rain Rot (Dermatophilosis)

1. **B** – Dermatophilosis is a common bacterial exudative crusting dermatitis of horses that typically occurs during periods of heavy rain. It is not primarily fungal (A), viral (C), or parasitic (D).
2. **B** – Lesions classically affect the dorsum of the trunk, especially the saddle region, and the dorsal surfaces of the hind cannon bones, and can also involve the pasterns. The other sites listed (A, C, D) are not the most characteristic locations.
3. **C** – No consistent age, breed, or sex predilection has been recognized for dermatophilosis. It is not limited to foals (A), older mares (B), or grey horses (D).
4. **B** – Horses kept in wet stalls or pens are predisposed to chronic pastern dermatitis because persistent moisture and skin maceration favor infection. Dry paddocks (A), routine grooming (C), and stall rest on mats (D) do not create the same risk.
5. **B** – Early lesions consist of follicular and nonfollicular papules and pustules that form tightly adherent crusts, which may coalesce into plaques with exudate. Flat depigmented macules (A), vesicles (C), or subcutaneous nodules with tracts (D) describe other conditions.
6. **B** – When crusts are removed, the distal hair shafts protrude through the crust, giving a characteristic “paint brush” appearance. Smooth bald areas (A), pigment changes (C), or depigmented hair patches (D) do not describe this.
7. **B** – Pastern or fetlock involvement can cause lameness and localized swelling. Neurologic signs (A), generalized pruritus without lesions (C), and ocular signs (D) are not typical direct consequences of pastern dermatophilosis.
8. **C** – The etiologic agent is Dermatophilus congolensis, a Gram‑positive, facultative anaerobic actinomycete. Staphylococcus (A) and Corynebacterium (D) can cause other skin diseases, while Microsporum canis (B) is a dermatophyte (fungus), not the cause here.
9. **B** – Skin damage (trauma, maceration) and moisture are the two key factors required for infection: damage allows colonization and moisture promotes organism growth. The other factor pairs (A, C, D) are not central to pathogenesis in this disease.
10. **B** – Biting flies, ticks, and contaminated fomites or crusts can transmit the organism between horses and environments. It is not purely airborne (A), only direct-contact transmitted (C), or venereal (D).
11. **B** – With truncal lesions, differential diagnoses include dermatophytosis and pemphigus foliaceus, among others. Dermatomyositis (A), neurologic disease (C), and colitis (D) affect different systems.
12. **A** – When only the pasterns are involved, differentials include staphylococcal folliculitis/furunculosis, dermatophytosis, Chorioptes infestation, trombiculosis, and irritant or allergic contact dermatitis, among others. Gastric (B), respiratory (C), or urinary (D) conditions are unrelated.
13. **B** – Lesions limited to white areas raise concern for photosensitization, which may be associated with liver disease, plant toxins, or intense UV exposure. Copper deficiency (A), PSSM (C), and influenza (D) have different manifestations.
14. **B** – Routine CBC/biochemistry/urinalysis are generally not of great value for diagnosing dermatophilosis, which is usually confirmed clinically and cytologically. They are not essential (A), not consistently abnormal (C), and do not identify the organism directly (D).
15. **B** – Cytology of exudate and/or crust stained with a modified Wright’s stain (Diff‑Quik) is a practical and rewarding diagnostic method. Skin biopsy (A) can help but is not usually first-line; fecal tests (C) and antibody titers (D) are not standard.
16. **B** – Dermatophilus organisms appear as cocci arranged in parallel rows within branching filaments, giving a “railroad track” appearance on cytology. Yeast chains (A), acid-fast rods (C), and spirochetes (D) represent other pathogens.
17. **C** – Crusts are infectious and zoonotic; handlers should wear gloves, gently remove crusts after soaking, and dispose of them in the trash rather than contaminating the environment. Leaving them in the stall (A), never removing crusts (B), or grinding them into bedding (D) is unsafe.
18. **B** – Key treatment elements include keeping the horse and environment clean and dry and gently removing crusts after soaking with an antibacterial shampoo. Constant moisture (A), corticosteroids alone (C), or avoiding all bathing (D) are inappropriate.
19. **A** – For focal lesions when bathing is not possible, topical 2–4% chlorhexidine, accelerated hydrogen peroxide, or benzoyl peroxide products can be used. Mineral oil/baby shampoo (B), lime sulfur alone (C), or plain water (D) are not standard monotherapies here.
20. **C** – Many cases of dermatophilosis are self‑limiting after environmental improvements, and the prognosis is generally excellent. It is not typically chronic and scarring (A), not commonly septic/fatal (B), and certainly not invariably lethal (D).
