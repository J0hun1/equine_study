### Answer key – Navicular Syndrome

1. **B** – Navicular syndrome is a degenerative disease complex of the navicular apparatus, often bilateral, rather than an acute infectious arthritis (A), congenital deformity (C), or simple sprain (D).
2. **A** – The navicular apparatus includes the navicular bone, navicular bursa, collateral sesamoid ligaments, distal impar ligament, and deep digital flexor tendon. The other options (B–D) list only isolated structures.
3. **B** – Narrow, upright feet with contracted heels and small frogs predispose to navicular problems because of abnormal load distribution. Wide flat feet (A), club feet (C), and laminitic feet (D) have different pathologies.
4. **B** – Horses with small hooves relative to body size concentrate high loads on a small area, increasing stress on the navicular apparatus. Large hooves (A) do not eliminate risk, and ponies/miniatures alone (C, D) do not account for the breed pattern.
5. **B** – Poor conformation, hoof imbalance (long toes, low heels), poor hoof care, and undersized shoes all contribute to excessive strain on navicular structures. Good farriery (A) is protective, while inactivity (C) and diet (D) are less direct risk factors.
6. **B** – In warmbloods, navicular syndrome may have a heritable component, suggesting a genetic predisposition. Viral (A), nutritional (C), or tick-borne (D) etiologies are not primary.
7. **A** – Typical presentation is bilateral forelimb lameness (often asymmetrical), with a shortened stride, shuffling gait, and stumbling; owners may misinterpret this as shoulder lameness. Hindlimb paralysis (B) and purely muscular or respiratory signs (C, D) are atypical.
8. **B** – Heel or frog pain on hoof tester exam is common in navicular horses, reflecting involvement of the caudal foot. Toe-only (A), hind sole (C), or coronary band (D) pain alone suggests other conditions.
9. **B** – Palmar digital nerve block desensitizes the heel region and often relieves navicular pain, unmasking lameness in the opposite foot. Abaxial sesamoid, peroneal, and infraorbital blocks (A, C, D) target different areas.
10. **B** – Radiographic changes may include cyst-like lesions, enlarged vascular channels, medullary sclerosis, enthesiophytes, bone fragments, and flexor cortex erosions. Normal bones (A), cannon osteomyelitis (C), or laminar separation (D) do not define navicular disease.
11. **B** – MRI offers the most detailed evaluation of all podotrochlear structures (bone, tendons, ligaments, bursa); CT is useful but less comprehensive. Radiographs (A) and scintigraphy (D) provide complementary but less detailed information.
12. **B** – Initial conservative management includes trimming and shoeing changes, rest, and systemic NSAIDs (e.g., phenylbutazone, firocoxib). Immediate neurectomy (A), blanket corticosteroids (C), or stall rest without farriery (D) are not recommended first-line.
13. **A** – Intrasynovial therapies include corticosteroids and/or biologics injected into the DIP joint or navicular bursa to reduce inflammation and pain. Solely antibiotics (B), local anesthetic (C), or oral vitamins (D) are insufficient.
14. **B** – Bisphosphonates such as tiludronate or clodronate can help by modulating bone turnover and alleviating bone-related pain; they do not cure the disease with a single dose (D). They are not useless (A) nor restricted to foals (C).
15. **A** – Mesenchymal stem cells, autologous conditioned serum, and platelet-rich plasma are used in some cases, especially where soft tissue lesions in the navicular region are documented. Antibiotics, dewormers, or antihistamines alone (B–D) are not regenerative therapies.
16. **B** – Navicular bursoscopy is indicated to debride dorsal DDFT tears, address flexor cortex erosions, and remove adhesions in the navicular bursa when present. Routine use in sound horses (C) or sole bruising without imaging (D) is not appropriate.
17. **A** – Palmar digital neurectomy is considered when medical and farriery management fail and MRI shows no significant DDFT damage, to avoid catastrophic tendon rupture post-desensitization. It is not first-line (B) and is inappropriate in foals (C) or as a diagnostic (D).
18. **B** – Complications include painful neuroma formation, recurrence of lameness due to nerve regrowth, and risk of undetected foot injury or infection due to loss of sensation. It is not always curative (A), and laminitis or colic alone (C, D) are not the principal concerns.
19. **B** – Owners must monitor feet carefully and often use full pad shoeing to protect the desensitized hoof and prevent trauma. Neglecting farriery (C) or increasing intense exercise (D) is unsafe.
20. **B** – Navicular syndrome is progressive and degenerative; while many horses improve with treatment, some deteriorate over time and require lifelong management. It is not an acute self-limiting problem (A), not always subclinical (C), and does not invariably cause rapid euthanasia (D).
