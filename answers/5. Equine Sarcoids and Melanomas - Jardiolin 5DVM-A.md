### Answer key – Equine Sarcoids and Melanomas

1. **B** – Equine sarcoids are locally invasive fibroblastic skin neoplasms strongly associated with BPV infection. They are not melanocytic tumors (A), systemic lymphoid cancers (C), or viral papillomas that always regress (D).
2. **B** – Equine melanomas are dark-pigmented tumors originating from melanocytes that may behave in a benign or malignant fashion. They are not hoof epithelial tumors (A), bone tumors (C), or purely inflammatory lesions (D).
3. **B** – Sarcoids are locally destructive and invasive but typically do not metastasize to distant organs. They do not commonly metastasize (A), are not fungal (C), and rarely resolve after trauma (often the opposite of D).
4. **A** – Infection with BPV, likely transmitted by biting flies or via wounds, is the major etiologic factor in sarcoid development. UV exposure (B), selenium deficiency (C), and EHV-1 (D) are not primary causes.
5. **B** – Sarcoids commonly affect young horses (around 3–6 years) of any breed, often at sites of previous injury or scarring. They are not restricted to older gray horses (A), foals (C), or specific draft breeds (D).
6. **B** – Melanomas are particularly common in older gray or white horses, including Lipizzaners, Arabians, and Percherons. They are rare in young non-gray horses (A), not limited to depigmented skin (C), and not specific to ponies (D).
7. **B** – Melanomas usually present as black nodules under or within the skin of the perineum, tail base, and parotid region. Coronary band/hoof wall (A), sole/cushion (C), or exclusively internal lesions (D) are not typical primary sites.
8. **B** – Many melanomas may remain benign for years but can undergo malignant transformation and metastasize to internal organs. They are not always benign (A), purely discolorations (C), or guaranteed to regress (D).
9. **A** – Sarcoids mainly affect the integumentary system, while melanomas also involve integumentary structures and may extend to lymphatic, digestive, and perineal regions when large or metastatic. The other options misidentify organ systems (B–D).
10. **B** – Owners frequently report one or more firm skin masses that gradually increase in size. Acute fever/respiratory distress (A), sudden collapse (C), or purely GI signs (D) are not characteristic presentations.
11. **A** – Sarcoids often present as subcutaneous masses, including around eyelids or canthi, which can become red, fleshy, ulcerated, and invasive; they can also occur on trunk and limbs in various morphologic forms. They are not always flat or non-palpable (B), limited to mucosa (C), or simply alopecic patches (D).
12. **B** – Equine melanomas are dark black nodules under or within the skin, most commonly at the perineum, tail base, and parotid region, and can form coalescing plaques. Non-pigmented papules (A), lip vesicles (C), or pastern plaques (D) describe other lesions.
13. **B** – Histopathologic examination of biopsy samples is the gold standard for confirming sarcoids and melanomas, differentiating them from other tumors. Skin scraping (A), fecal exams (C), and serology (D) are not definitive for these neoplasms.
14. **B** – Incomplete or aggressive biopsy of sarcoids can exacerbate the lesion and stimulate rapid regrowth, so biopsy must be carefully planned. Biopsy does not resolve the lesion (A), is not contraindicated solely for zoonosis (C), and is diagnostically valuable when done properly (D).
15. **B** – Ultrasonography is useful for assessing tumor margins and depth; CT and MRI provide further detail for deep or periocular lesions. CT alone (A), plain radiography (C), or endoscopy (D) are less informative for superficial skin masses.
16. **B** – Surgical excision is a primary treatment for both sarcoids and melanomas when complete margins are achievable. Antibiotics (A), topical steroids alone (C), and diet changes (D) are insufficient as sole treatments.
17. **A** – Cryotherapy is effective for small or superficial sarcoids and melanomas by freezing and destroying abnormal tissue. Oral antifungals (B), hoof laser therapy (C), and UV exposure (D) are not standard frontline options.
18. **B** – BCG immunotherapy is specifically used in some sarcoids and has reported success around 70%. Interferon (A) and the vaccines listed (C, D) are not standard immunotherapies for sarcoids.
19. **B** – Sarcoids respond to local immunotherapy (BCG) and chemotherapy (e.g., cisplatin, 5-FU), while melanomas commonly rely on surgical excision and cryotherapy; radiation may be used in select cases. Systemic antibiotics alone (A), antifungals/dewormers (C), and “no treatment available” (D) are incorrect.
20. **B** – Large melanomas, especially in perineal regions, may obstruct defecation or interfere with normal function by mass effect. Laminitis (A), pruritus alone (C), and “transformation into sarcoids” (D) are not typical concerns.
