### Answer key – Cholangiohepatitis

1. **B** – Cholangiohepatitis is defined as inflammation of both the bile ducts (cholangitis) and the surrounding liver tissue (hepatitis). It is not isolated gallbladder inflammation (A), purely metabolic (C), or a vascular anomaly (D).
2. **A** – In adult horses, ascending bacterial infection via the bile ducts by Gram-negative enteric organisms is a major cause. Primary viral hepatitis (B), laminitis (C), and vitamin E deficiency (D) are not primary etiologies here.
3. **B** – In foals, cholangiohepatitis is often secondary to umbilical vein infection or bloodborne spread leading to hepatic abscesses. Portosystemic shunts (A), Parascaris migration (C), and ulcers (D) are different conditions.
4. **B** – Common pathogens include *E. coli*, *Klebsiella*, and related Gram-negative enteric bacteria. Salmonella/Clostridium chauvoei (A), Mycoplasma (C), and *Staphylococcus aureus* (D) are not the main organisms described.
5. **A** – Typical clinical signs include weight loss, icterus, fever, abdominal pain, and in severe cases hepatic failure with encephalopathy and photosensitization. Respiratory disease (B), isolated lameness (C), or colic alone (D) do not capture the syndrome.
6. **B** – Focal abscesses may result in chronic colic, ill thrift, and nonspecific signs over time. Sudden blindness (A), acute diarrhea (C), or pruritus alone (D) are not classic.
7. **B** – A hallmark pattern is a marked increase in GGT (often >300 U/L) with milder elevations of AST/SDH, reflecting biliary and periportal liver involvement. CK predominance (A), creatinine changes (C), or normal enzymes (D) are not typical.
8. **B** – Neutrophilia, increased fibrinogen, and elevations in conjugated bilirubin, bile acids, and globulins support an inflammatory hepatobiliary process. The other options (A, C, D) do not match the described lab pattern.
9. **A** – Ultrasound findings of distended bile ducts with sludge or calculi, plus hepatic parenchymal changes (fibrosis, altered echogenicity), are suggestive. Isolated splenomegaly (B), free gas (C), or renal enlargement alone (D) indicate other problems.
10. **B** – Needle aspirate or biopsy of liver for culture and histopathology helps confirm cholangiohepatitis and guide antimicrobial choice. Skin biopsy (A), fecal tests (C), and joint taps (D) assess other systems.
11. **A** – Fever, jaundice, markedly elevated GGT, leukocytosis, and hyperglobulinemia together strongly support cholangiohepatitis over other chronic colic causes. The other patterns (B–D) lack the hepatobiliary signature.
12. **A** – Conditions mimicking cholangiohepatitis include chronic/recurrent colic, right dorsal displacement of the colon, neoplasia, and hepatic abscessation. Gastric ulcers (B), laminitis (C), and airway disease (D) are differentials for other complaints.
13. **B** – Long-term antibiotics (3 weeks–6 months) tailored by culture, along with NSAIDs and supportive care, are central to therapy. Short courses (A), antifungals only (C), or steroids alone (D) are inadequate.
14. **A** – Common regimens include trimethoprim–sulfa, enrofloxacin, metronidazole, ceftiofur, and penicillin-based combinations, often in multimodal protocols. Topical-only therapy (B), antiparasitics (C), or macrolides in adults (D) are not standard first-line choices.
15. **B** – Icteric horses can develop photosensitization because impaired bile excretion allows photodynamic substances to accumulate; sunlight exposure then worsens skin lesions. Dehydration (A), hypothermia (C), and melatonin (D) are not the main concerns.
16. **B** – Surgical intervention is generally reserved for cases with obstructing bile calculi or nonresponsive abscesses where drainage or resection is needed. Routine surgery for all (A), triggers based on GGT alone (C), and cosmetic motives (D) are inappropriate.
17. **B** – Antibiotics should be continued until GGT falls below approximately 100 U/L or normalizes, with repeat GGT and follow-up imaging to ensure resolution. Stopping early (A, C) or skipping follow-up (D) risks relapse or incomplete treatment.
18. **B** – Prognosis is good when bile ducts are patent and liver echogenicity is near normal, especially with early therapy. It is not invariably fatal (A) or uniformly poor (C), and the condition is not so rare that prognosis is unknown (D).
19. **B** – Even very high GGT values can be compatible with recovery if aggressive medical management is instituted; this elevation alone does not guarantee death. Transplant (C) is not an option for horses, and the value is clinically meaningful (D).
20. **B** – Cholangiohepatitis is characterized by inflammation of liver and bile ducts, commonly in adult horses, often due to ascending bacterial infection, with GGT elevation as a key diagnostic marker. The other options misidentify affected organs or pathophysiology.
