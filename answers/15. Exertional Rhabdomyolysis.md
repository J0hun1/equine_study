### Answer key – Exertional Rhabdomyolysis

1. **B** – ER is defined as a syndrome of muscle fatigue, pain, and cramping associated with exercise, with skeletal muscle necrosis and enzyme elevation. It is not primarily infectious (A), a joint disease (C), or a bone metabolic disorder (D).
2. **B** – The core mechanism is disturbance of muscle energy metabolism or calcium regulation, leading to sustained contraction, metabolic exhaustion, and cell damage. Neuromuscular junction problems alone (A), immune demyelination (C), or thyroid excess (D) do not describe ER.
3. **A** – Marked post-exercise increases in CK and AST are hallmarks of ER, reflecting muscle fiber necrosis. Hematologic changes (B), isolated hypercalcemia with low CK (C), and pigment-free isosthenuric urine (D) are not typical.
4. **B** – Classic signs include excessive sweating, painful firm gluteal and lumbar muscles, reluctance or refusal to move, and dark “coffee-colored” urine from myoglobinuria. Neurologic signs (A), respiratory disease (C), and cardiac tamponade signs (D) do not fit typical ER presentation.
5. **B** – Chronic ER is associated with inherited or metabolic defects affecting glycogen storage or calcium handling, explaining recurrent episodes. Persistent infection (A), liver failure (C), or tendon trauma (D) are not the main drivers.
6. **C** – Sporadic ER involves single or infrequent episodes often related to overexertion, poor conditioning, or management factors, while chronic ER involves recurrent episodes linked to inherited/metabolic myopathies. The other pairings invert or misstate these relationships (A, B, D).
7. **B** – Overexertion beyond the horse’s level of training is a key trigger for sporadic ER. GYS1 (A) and RYR1 (C) mutations are associated with chronic forms (PSSM and MH), and high dietary fat (D) is usually protective rather than causative.
8. **C** – Chronic ER often reflects genetic/metabolic muscle disorders such as PSSM (GYS1), MFM, or MH (RYR1). Short-term dehydration (A), viral myositis (B), and acute hypoglycemia (D) do not explain the chronic, recurrent pattern.
9. **A** – Quarter Horses, Drafts, and Morgans are predisposed to Type 1 PSSM. Malignant Hyperthermia (RYR1) is more associated with Quarter Horses, not Arabians (B), Standardbreds have broader associations (C), and Warmbloods are more linked with Type 2 PSSM/MFM than purely sporadic ER (D).
10. **B** – Chronic ER (e.g., RER) is classically seen in young to middle-aged, fit, nervous horses, especially in performance breeds. Old calm drafts (A), neonates (C), and sedentary ponies (D) do not match this profile.
11. **A** – Elevated CK and AST after work, often with myoglobinuria, is characteristic of ER. Hyperglycemia and glycosuria (B), bone lysis (C), or eosinophilia with skin lesions (D) point toward other conditions.
12. **B** – An exercise challenge test, comparing CK before and after a standardized work bout, can reveal subclinical ER. ACTH (A) tests PPID, cortisol (C) tests HPA axis function, and fecal occult blood (D) screens for GI bleeding.
13. **A** – Type 1 PSSM shows amylase-resistant PAS-positive glycogen on biopsy and is associated with a GYS1 mutation. Type 2 PSSM has amylase-sensitive aggregates (B), MFM involves desmin aggregates (C), and RYR1 mutation (D) indicates MH rather than PSSM1.
14. **B** – The correct acute response is to stop exercise immediately and move the horse to a quiet, well-bedded stall. Continuing exercise (A), giving diuretics without fluids (C), or turning the horse out to move freely (D) risk worsening muscle damage and renal injury.
15. **B** – IV fluids help correct dehydration and protect the kidneys from myoglobin-induced damage. NSAIDs like flunixin should be used cautiously and typically only if the horse is well hydrated (not A), and high-starch diets (C) or diuresis without fluids (D) can be harmful.
16. **B** – For chronic management, a high-fat (> 15% DE), low-starch (< 10% DE) diet with adequate forage (1.5–2% BW/day) is recommended. High-starch/low-fat (A), low-fiber/high-sweet-feed (C), or uncontrolled grazing without dietary control (D) predispose to episodes.
17. **B** – Dantrolene at 4 mg/kg PO 60–90 minutes before exercise is used to reduce Ca²⁺ release in susceptible horses. Phenylbutazone (A), acepromazine (C), and flunixin (D) at those doses/timings are not the standard specific therapy for chronic ER.
18. **C** – Preventive management centers on consistent exercise, low-starch/high-fat diet, adequate hydration and electrolytes, and minimizing stress. Irregular training with long rest (A), high-starch diets and confinement (B), and avoiding turnout with high-energy feeds (D) all increase risk.
19. **B** – Sporadic ER generally carries an excellent prognosis when managed with rest and gradual return to work. Chronic forms can be managed long term (C), ER is not invariably grave (A), and myoglobinuric renal failure is a real concern (D).
20. **B** – ER is best understood as a group of exertional muscle disorders divided into sporadic (often environmental/management) and chronic (genetic/metabolic) categories. It is not a single overexertion disease (A), not purely infectious (C), and diagnosis uses enzymes and other tests in addition to biopsy (D).
