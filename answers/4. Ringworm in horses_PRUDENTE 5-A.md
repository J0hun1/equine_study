### Answer key – Ringworm in Horses (Dermatophytosis)

1. **B** – Equine ringworm is a superficial fungal infection affecting skin, hair, and other keratinized structures. It does not typically cause deep systemic mycosis (A), viral pustules (C), or bacterial cellulitis (D).
2. **A** – The primary causative dermatophytes in horses are *Trichophyton equinum* and *T. mentagrophytes*; *Nannizzia gypsea* and *Microsporum canis* may also occur. The other organisms listed (B–D) are yeasts, bacteria, or systemic fungi not typically responsible for equine ringworm.
3. **B** – Dermatophytes feed on keratin in hair shafts and superficial stratum corneum, explaining their superficial, keratin-associated lesions. Collagen and elastin (A), lipids (C), and melanin (D) are not their primary substrates.
4. **C** – Transmission occurs via direct contact with infected animals or indirectly via contaminated grooming tools, tack, stalls, and environment. Aerosol spread (A), vertical transmission (B), and larval migration (D) are not characteristic for dermatophytosis.
5. **B** – In horses, ringworm classically remains a superficial infection of skin and hair, without deep systemic spread. Deep invasion and fungemia (A, C) or exclusive hoof involvement (D) are not typical.
6. **C** – All ages can be infected, but younger horses and those with compromised skin or immune status have higher risk. It is not limited strictly to geriatrics (A), foals (B), or stallions (D).
7. **A** – Typical lesions are circular or irregular alopecic areas with broken hairs, scaling, crusting, and mild erythema. Diffuse hyperpigmentation (B), deep draining tracts (C), or vesicles/bullae at mucocutaneous junctions (D) describe other dermatologic conditions.
8. **A** – The girth and saddle regions (“girth itch”) are commonly affected initially, with possible spread to neck, flanks, chest, and head. The other locations (B–D) are less classic for equine ringworm.
9. **B** – Many equine dermatophytes are zoonotic, and infection can spread from horses to humans, so biosecurity is important. It is not completely non-zoonotic (A), not only human-to-horse (C), and “zoonotic only in immunocompromised horses” (D) is misframed.
10. **B** – Damp, humid environments with shared, poorly cleaned tack and grooming tools favor dermatophyte persistence and spread. Dry, well-managed stables (A) and strong biosecurity (C, D) reduce risk.
11. **B** – Fungal culture of hairs and skin scrapings from active lesion margins is the most accurate diagnostic method for dermatophytosis. Bacterial culture (A), antibody titers (C), and fecal tests (D) are not standard for ringworm diagnosis.
12. **B** – Sampling should include the active lesion margin, broken hairs, crusts, and scales; alcohol scrubbing before sampling (A) can reduce culture yield. Normal hair (C) and blood (D) are not ideal samples.
13. **B** – Dermatophilosis (rain scald) can clinically resemble ringworm with crusting and alopecia, making it an important differential. The other conditions (A, C, D) primarily affect other systems or present differently.
14. **B** – Preferred topical whole-body, leave-on therapies include lime sulfur (1:16), enilconazole (1:100), or 2% miconazole/2% chlorhexidine shampoo. Bleach (A, C) is irritating and not first-line, and plain water (C) lacks antifungal activity.
15. **B** – Systemic oral antifungals are often avoided due to cost, potential adverse effects, and the fact that most equine ringworm cases respond to topical therapy and environmental management. They are not inherently ineffective (A) and do not cause recurrence (C), nor are they restricted to cattle (D).
16. **B** – Bleach is discouraged directly on horses because it is irritating and a human health hazard; other disinfectants are preferred. It is not first-line (A), should not be used undiluted on lesions (C), and is not specifically limited to wounds (D).
17. **B** – The major complication is spread to other horses (and sometimes other species) due to environmental spore contamination. Systemic mycosis (A), universal follicle destruction (C), and hoof deformities (D) are not typical.
18. **B** – With proper topical therapy and good hygiene, prognosis is generally good, and many cases may even self-resolve as immunity develops. It is not usually poor (A), consistently guarded due to systemic spread (C), or rare and unknown (D).
19. **C** – Avoiding shared tack and grooming tools without thorough cleaning/disinfection is critical to prevent stable-wide transmission. Diet (A), avoiding clipping (B), or eliminating turnout (D) are less directly relevant.
20. **B** – Dermatophyte spores persist for long periods on wood, soil, and tack, so environmental decontamination is as important as treating the horse. It is incorrect to assume they die quickly (A), that the environment is irrelevant (C), or that control is unnecessary once crusting occurs (D).
