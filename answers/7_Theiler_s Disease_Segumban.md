### Answer key – Theiler’s Disease (Acute Hepatitis)

1. **B** – Theiler’s disease is an acute, often fulminant hepatic failure with encephalopathy in adult horses, not a chronic foal hepatitis (A), parasitic cholangitis (C), or congenital biliary defect (D).
2. **A** – Many cases are associated with prior administration of equine-origin blood products (e.g., tetanus antitoxin, plasma) 4–10 weeks earlier. NSAIDs (B), dewormers (C), and toxoid alone (D) are not the classic associations.
3. **B** – It is also termed “serum-associated hepatitis” or “serum sickness,” reflecting its link to biologic products. The other names (A, C, D) refer to different diseases.
4. **B** – Adult horses—often broodmares on pasture in the fall—are commonly affected, though it can occur in other adults. Neonates (A), yearlings (C), and geriatric ponies only (D) are not the primary populations.
5. **B** – The disease has a sudden onset and rapid progression; many horses die within 2–6 days of clinical onset. It is not a slow chronic condition (A), nor always subclinical and self-limiting (C), and more than mild jaundice is typical (D).
6. **B** – Clinical signs include icterus, dark urine (bilirubinuria), frequent yawning, signs of hepatic encephalopathy (e.g., acute blindness, aimless wandering), depression or maniacal behavior, and neurologic signs. Lameness (A), respiratory signs (C), or colic alone (D) do not characterize the syndrome.
7. **B** – Theiler’s disease is associated with several equine hepatotropic viruses, including TDAV, NPHV/EHCV, EPgV, and EqPV-H. Orthomyxoviruses (A), EIAV (C), and herpesviruses (D) cause other conditions.
8. **B** – Biochemistry typically reveals marked increases in liver enzymes—especially AST often in the thousands—with elevated SDH and GLDH, plus increased biliary enzymes and bilirubin. CK elevation alone (A), isolated hypercalcemia (C), or normal enzymes (D) are not typical.
9. **C** – Hemoglobinuria indicates severe hemolysis and is a poor prognostic sign when present; it may accompany bilirubinuria. Glucosuria (A), bilirubinuria alone (B), or isosthenuria (D) are less specific for poor prognosis.
10. **B** – Common abnormalities include prolonged PT and PTT, hyperlactatemia, hyperammonemia, and elevated bile acids, reflecting hepatic failure and coagulopathy. The other patterns (A, C, D) do not match the described disease.
11. **B** – Ultrasonography may show a smaller-than-normal, more hypoechoic liver, consistent with acute severe hepatic injury. Marked hepatomegaly (A), uniformly normal imaging (C), or isolated biliary sludge (D) are not typical hallmarks.
12. **B** – Liver biopsy is usually not indicated in classic cases because histologic results do not change therapy and biopsy can be risky in coagulopathic, unstable patients. Histology is not normal (A), risk of viral spread is not the main concern (C), and biopsy is not required in all cases (D).
13. **B** – Histology reveals severe centrilobular or massive hepatocellular necrosis/apoptosis, with portal areas less severely affected but showing mononuclear infiltrates and bile duct proliferation. Mild portal inflammation (A), pure lipidosis (C), or isolated cholestasis (D) do not describe this pattern.
14. **B** – Alzheimer type II astrocytes are a characteristic finding in brains of horses with hepatic encephalopathy from Theiler’s disease. Demyelination (A), Purkinje cell loss (C), or spongiform change (D) are features of other disorders.
15. **B** – Management focuses on intensive supportive care: IV fluids, nutritional support, measures to reduce neurotoxins and cerebral edema, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial therapy, and antioxidant support. Increased exercise (A), forced diuresis (C), or liver resection (D) are inappropriate.
16. **A** – Initial hypertonic saline followed by balanced isotonic crystalloids is appropriate to restore intravascular volume and maintain hydration and tissue perfusion. Oral water alone (B), hypertonic glucose only (C), or colloids without crystalloids (D) are inadequate or inappropriate.
17. **B** – Metronidazole, neomycin (short-term), and lactulose help decrease ammonia production and absorption from the GI tract, reducing encephalopathy. Diazepam (A) is mainly for seizures; the other drug pairs (C, D) target different issues.
18. **C** – Sedation must be minimal and judicious; low-dose detomidine, gabapentin, or pregabalin may be used carefully to reduce risk of self-injury without excessively depressing CNS or promoting head-down posture. Heavy sedation (A), total prohibition (B), or “no sedation needed” (D) are unsafe or unrealistic.
19. **B** – Barbiturates and excessive head lowering can increase intracranial pressure and cerebral edema, worsening neurologic signs in hepatic encephalopathy. They do not directly worsen bile obstruction (A), universally cause diarrhea (C), or “neutralize” hepatic enzymes (D).
20. **A** – Severe HE carries a poor prognosis; however, horses that remain eating, receive good supportive care, and show declining SDH/GLDH with improved clinical signs have a reasonable chance of full recovery, and no proven long-term sequelae in survivors are reported. It is not invariably fatal (B), nor does jaundice alone preclude recovery (C), and survivors do not universally develop cirrhosis (D).
