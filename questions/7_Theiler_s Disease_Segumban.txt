D. Restricted to mild, transient jaundice

Q6. Which clinical signs are commonly reported in horses with Theiler’s disease?
A. Single limb lameness with digital pulses

A. Orthomyxoviruses causing influenza
B. Viruses such as TDAV (Theiler disease–associated virus), NPHV/EHCV, EPgV, and EqPV-H
C. Retroviruses like EIAV
D. Herpesviruses causing EHM

Q8. A key biochemical feature of acute Theiler’s disease is:
A. Marked elevation of creatine kinase (CK) only
B. Marked increases in hepatic enzymes, especially AST often near or above 2000–4000 IU/L, with elevated SDH and GLDH
C. Isolated hypercalcemia with low liver enzymes
D. Normal liver enzymes with only low glucose

Q9. In a horse with suspected Theiler’s disease, which urine finding is considered a poor prognostic indicator?
A. Glucosuria
B. Bilirubinuria alone
C. Hemoglobinuria
D. Isosthenuria

Q10. Which coagulation and metabolic abnormalities are often seen in Theiler’s disease?
A. Shortened prothrombin time and hypolactatemia
B. Prolonged prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times, hyperlactatemia, hyperammonemia, and elevated bile acids
C. Isolated thrombocytosis with normal clotting times
D. Severe hypoproteinemia with normal ammonia

Q11. What is the typical ultrasonographic finding in the liver of horses with Theiler’s disease?
A. Markedly enlarged, hyperechoic liver with nodular masses
B. Smaller-than-normal liver that appears more hypoechoic
C. Completely normal liver in all cases
D. Only biliary sludge without parenchymal changes

Q12. Why is liver biopsy generally not indicated in horses with “classic” Theiler’s disease?
A. Histologic findings are always normal
B. Biopsy is unnecessary because histology will likely not change therapy and may be risky
C. Biopsy is contraindicated due to high risk of viral spread
D. Biopsy is required for diagnosis in all cases

Q13. Which histopathologic finding characterizes the liver in Theiler’s disease?
A. Mild portal inflammation without necrosis
B. Severe centrilobular or massive hepatocellular necrosis/apoptosis with relatively less affected portal areas and mononuclear infiltrates
C. Diffuse hepatic lipidosis with no necrosis
D. Pure cholestasis without necrosis or inflammation

Q14. Which neurologic histologic feature is typically present in the brains of horses with Theiler’s disease?
A. Neuronal demyelination only
B. Alzheimer type II astrocytes in many cases
C. Purkinje cell loss in the cerebellum
D. Spongiform change in the cortex

Q15. The primary goals of therapy in Theiler’s disease include:
A. Increasing exercise to improve liver perfusion
B. Providing supportive care with IV fluids, nutritional support, and therapies to reduce neurotoxins, inflammation, and oxidative damage
C. Rapidly reducing liver size with diuretics
D. Immediate surgical resection of affected liver lobes

Q16. Which fluid therapy approach is appropriate in these patients?
A. Hypertonic saline followed by balanced isotonic crystalloids to maintain hydration and perfusion
B. Only oral water, no IV fluids
C. Hypertonic glucose solution only
D. Colloid boluses without crystalloids

Q17. Which medications may be used to manage hepatic encephalopathy and reduce GI-derived ammonia in Theiler’s disease?
A. Diazepam alone
B. Metronidazole, neomycin (short-term), and lactulose
C. Furosemide and digoxin
D. Sucralfate and omeprazole

Q18. Which statement about sedation in horses with hepatic encephalopathy is MOST accurate?
A. Heavy sedation is ideal to keep the horse recumbent
B. All sedatives are contraindicated
C. Minimal sedation (e.g., low-dose detomidine, gabapentin, pregabalin) may be used carefully to prevent self-injury
D. Sedation is unnecessary because these horses are always comatose

Q19. Why should barbiturates and excessive head lowering be used with caution in these cases?
A. They can directly worsen biliary obstruction
B. They may increase cerebral edema and exacerbate neurologic signs
C. They cause severe diarrhea in all horses
D. They neutralize hepatic enzymes

Q20. Which prognostic statement is MOST accurate for Theiler’s disease?
A. Severe hepatic encephalopathy is associated with a poor prognosis, whereas horses that continue eating for several days and show declining SDH/GLDH with clinical improvement may fully recover
B. All affected horses die regardless of treatment
C. Recovery is impossible once jaundice appears
D. Surviving horses always develop chronic cirrhosis
