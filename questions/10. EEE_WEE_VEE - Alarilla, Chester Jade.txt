C. Coughing and nasal discharge only
D. No clinical signs at all

Q10. Neurologic signs of equine encephalitides typically include:

B. Pruritus and self-mutilation only
C. Purely respiratory stridor
D. Isolated laminitis without CNS signs

Q11. Which additional clinical manifestations may be observed in severe cases?
A. Colic-like signs, reduced alertness, recumbency, and death
B. Only dermatologic lesions
C. Only laminitis and hoof cracks
D. Only ocular discharge

Q12. In serologic diagnosis of EEE/WEE/VEE, which finding is considered confirmatory for recent infection?
A. IgM capture ELISA titer ≥400 or a fourfold rise between acute and convalescent samples
B. Single low positive IgG titer with no change over time
C. Negative IgM and no titer change
D. Positive fecal PCR only

Q13. For EEEV specifically, how does the EEEV:WEEV titer ratio support diagnosis?
A. A ratio ≤1 is strongly indicative of EEEV
B. A ratio ≥4 is suspicious and ≥8 is strongly indicative of EEEV infection
C. Only a ratio of exactly 2 is diagnostic
D. Titer ratios are not useful

Q14. Which CSF findings are consistent with arboviral encephalomyelitis?
A. Purely eosinophilic pleocytosis with low protein
B. Neutrophilic pleocytosis with elevated total protein concentration
C. Normal cell counts and proteins in all cases
D. Purely lymphocytic pleocytosis with low protein

Q15. Which disease is an important differential diagnosis for equine arboviral encephalitis because it can produce similar neurologic signs?
A. West Nile virus encephalomyelitis
B. Equine influenza
C. Strangles
D. Equine sarcoids

Q16. Which other conditions are included in the differential diagnosis list for acute neurologic disease in horses?
A. Rabies, leukoencephalomalacia (moldy corn poisoning), and hepatic encephalopathy
B. Only laminitis and colic
C. Only navicular syndrome
D. Only gastric ulcers

Q17. Which statement BEST describes the treatment approach for EEE/WEE/VEE in horses?
A. Specific antiviral drugs are routinely curative
B. Treatment is primarily supportive: fluid and metabolic support, prevention of self-trauma, and sometimes corticosteroids
C. Antibiotics alone are sufficient
D. Only NSAIDs are required

Q18. Which mortality rates are MOST accurate for EEEV, WEEV, and VEEV respectively?
A. EEEV 20–40%, WEEV 85–100%, VEEV 40–80%
B. EEEV 85–100%, WEEV 20–40%, VEEV 40–80%
C. EEEV 0%, WEEV 10–20%, VEEV 100%
D. All three have <10% mortality

Q19. Why is vaccination critical in endemic areas for these viruses?
A. It completely eliminates all mosquitoes
B. It significantly reduces the incidence and severity of disease and is the main preventive measure in horses
C. It cures infected horses
D. It only protects humans, not horses

Q20. What is the zoonotic potential of EEEV/WEEV compared to VEEV?
A. All three viruses make horses efficient amplifiers for human infection
B. EEEV and WEEV: horses are dead-end hosts; VEEV: horses can act as amplifying hosts and pose a greater zoonotic risk during outbreaks
C. None of the viruses have any zoonotic risk
D. Only WEEV is zoonotic
