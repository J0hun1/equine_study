Q5. Which statement regarding the relationship between EMS and PPID is MOST accurate?
A. EMS and PPID never occur together
B. PPID is the only cause of laminitis in older horses, not EMS

D. Horses with PPID should not be tested for insulin dysregulation

Q6. What is the main mechanism by which EMS predisposes horses to laminitis?
A. Bacterial toxin absorption from the gut
B. Direct damage to the digital cushion by obesity
C. Hyperinsulinemia leading to laminar pathology

Q8. In a horse with EMS, subtle evidence of prior laminitis may include:
A. Petechial hemorrhages on mucous membranes
B. Hoof growth rings and radiographic evidence of third phalanx rotation
C. Swelling of digital flexor tendons without hoof change
D. Sole bruising only

Q9. The primary goal of diagnostic testing for EMS is to:
A. Confirm hypothyroidism as the underlying cause of obesity
B. Document insulin dysregulation through appropriate testing
C. Identify pituitary tumors via MRI
D. Detect bacterial pathogens in blood culture

Q10. Why is it important to perform EMS diagnostic testing in a controlled, low‑stress environment?
A. Stress and diet can alter blood glucose and insulin concentrations, affecting test interpretation
B. Stress decreases the risk of laminitis and masks EMS
C. Stress has no impact on endocrine testing results
D. Stress only affects liver enzymes, not insulin

Q11. During an oral sugar test (OST) in a horse suspected of EMS, which result supports a diagnosis of insulin dysregulation?
A. Insulin concentration of 20 mIU/mL at 60–90 minutes
B. Insulin concentration of 45 mIU/mL or greater at 60–90 minutes
C. Insulin concentration of 10 mIU/mL at 2 hours
D. Insulin concentration that decreases after corn syrup administration

Q12. A fasted horse undergoes an oral glucose test (OGT). Which finding is consistent with insulin dysregulation?
A. Insulin ≥ 65 mIU/mL 2 hours after 0.75 g/kg dextrose
B. Insulin ≤ 20 mIU/mL 2 hours after dextrose
C. Insulin unchanged from baseline at 24 hours
D. Insulin < 10 mIU/mL 30 minutes after dextrose

Q13. Which resting insulin concentration indicates an ACCEPTABLE response to current management and LOW risk of laminitis in a horse with EMS?
A. ≤ 50 mIU/mL
B. Between 50 and 100 mIU/mL
C. ≥ 100 mIU/mL
D. ≥ 200 mIU/mL

Q14. Which resting insulin concentration suggests inadequate management and HIGH risk of laminitis?
A. ≤ 20 mIU/mL
B. 30–40 mIU/mL
C. ≥ 100 mIU/mL
D. Exactly 50 mIU/mL

Q15. Which dietary recommendation is MOST appropriate for managing a horse with EMS?
A. Free‑choice pasture and grain to maintain weight
B. Eliminating grazing, grains, and treats; feeding low‑NSC hay divided into several small meals
C. Feeding high‑NSC hay once daily to reduce boredom
D. Unlimited carrots and apples as low‑calorie treats

Q16. When feeding hay to an OBESE horse with EMS, which guideline is MOST appropriate initially?
A. 0.5% of body weight per day of any available hay
B. 1.5% of body weight per day of low‑NSC hay, avoiding severe restriction that could trigger hyperlipemia
C. 4% of body weight per day of high‑NSC hay
D. Only pasture, no hay, to encourage movement

Q17. In horses with EMS, how should nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) intake per meal be managed?
A. There is no need to limit NSC per meal
B. NSC should not exceed 0.1 g/kg per meal
C. NSC should be at least 1 g/kg per meal
D. NSC should be restricted only in the evening

Q18. Which management strategy best describes appropriate hoof care for horses with EMS?
A. Hoof care is not necessary unless acute lameness is present
B. Radiographs are never indicated in EMS cases
C. Regular hoof trimming every 4 weeks by a skilled farrier and radiographic monitoring for laminitis
D. Only corrective shoeing is required once laminitis is severe

Q19. After laminitis has resolved in a horse with EMS, which statement about exercise is MOST accurate?
A. Exercise should be permanently avoided
B. Only light hand‑walking once monthly is beneficial
C. Gradual, structured exercise improves insulin sensitivity by building muscle and reducing fat mass
D. Exercise has no effect on insulin regulation

Q20. Which statement best summarizes prevention of EMS in at‑risk horses?
A. Provide high‑NSC diets year‑round but limit exercise
B. Feed according to generic guidelines, regardless of body condition
C. Provide an appropriate diet, maintain normal body condition, and restrict grazing during times of high soluble carbohydrates
D. Allow unrestricted pasture access in spring and autumn to promote natural weight changes
