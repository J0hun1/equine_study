Q1. Osteoarthritis (OA) in horses is BEST described as:
A. An acute infectious arthritis due to bacteria
B. A chronic, progressive, noninfectious deterioration of articular cartilage and associated joint structures
C. A purely developmental cartilage defect in foals
D. A systemic autoimmune disease

Q2. Which joint changes are typically associated with OA?
A. Only synovial effusion
B. Cartilage loss, subchondral bone sclerosis, osteophyte formation, and synovial membrane inflammation
C. Pure tendon rupture without bone or cartilage changes
D. Exclusively joint ankylosis at birth

Q3. Which horses are most predisposed to OA?
A. Only geriatric pasture pets
B. Athletic horses of all ages and both sexes undergoing repetitive training
C. Only foals under 6 months
D. Only breeding stallions

Q4. OA commonly develops secondary to which factors?
A. Joint instability, trauma, abnormal biomechanical stress, poor joint conformation, repetitive stress, ligament/tendon injuries, infectious arthritis, or osteochondrosis
B. Simple dietary vitamin deficiency
C. Only laminitis
D. Seasonal temperature changes

Q5. Which pathophysiologic process BEST explains cartilage damage in OA?
A. Inflammatory mediators (PGE₂, IL-1, TNF-α, MMPs) from synovitis drive matrix degradation and reduce synovial fluid quality
B. Direct bacterial invasion of cartilage
C. Pure mechanical wear without any biochemical component
D. Autoantibodies to myelin

Q6. What changes occur in synovial fluid during OA?
A. Increased viscosity and hyaluronic acid concentration
B. Reduced viscosity and decreased hyaluronic acid concentration, leading to poor lubrication
C. Conversion to pus-filled exudate in all cases
D. No change at any stage

Q7. How does subchondral bone respond in OA?
A. It becomes softer and more compliant
B. It becomes sclerotic and less compliant, transmitting greater forces to cartilage and promoting osteophyte formation
C. It is unaffected by OA
D. It liquefies and forms cysts only

Q8. The hallmark lesion of OA is:
A. Articular cartilage degeneration, with pain arising from periarticular soft tissues and subchondral bone
B. Pure synovial membrane infection
C. Primary ligament rupture without joint involvement
D. Bone neoplasia

Q9. Which historical finding often suggests OA in a horse?
A. Sudden onset of neurologic deficits with seizures
B. History of intra-articular fracture, osteochondrosis, dislocation, or ligament injury, with insidious lameness in low-motion joints and acute lameness in high-motion joints
C. Isolated respiratory distress
D. Only skin lesions

Q10. Typical physical examination findings in equine OA include:
A. Severe colic and abdominal distension
B. Variable lameness, pain on flexion of affected joint(s), synovial effusion (esp. in high-motion joints), reduced range of motion, stiffness after rest, thickened joint capsules, periarticular hardening, and crepitus
C. No lameness but systemic fever
D. Pure hindlimb paralysis

Q11. Which imaging modality is most commonly used to diagnose OA changes?
A. Radiography, showing joint space narrowing, osteophytes, periosteal proliferation, and subchondral sclerosis
B. CT only
C. Endoscopy
D. Ultrasonography of the abdomen

Q12. Which modality offers direct visualization of articular cartilage and subchondral bone lesions?
A. Arthroscopy
B. MRI only
C. Nuclear scintigraphy only
D. Fecal imaging

Q13. Main treatment goals in managing OA are to:
A. Eradicate all joint bacteria
B. Reduce joint inflammation and pain, restore cartilage homeostasis and mobility, and delay degenerative progression
C. Shorten all tendons surgically
D. Increase joint load to promote bone growth

Q14. Which nonpharmacologic management strategies are appropriate for OA?
A. Rest and controlled exercise, weight management, corrective shoeing, cold therapy, hydrotherapy, physiotherapy, and using soft footing
B. Strict prolonged stall rest with no movement
C. High-intensity exercise on hard surfaces only
D. No change in training regimen

Q15. Which NSAIDs are commonly used to control pain in equine OA?
A. Phenylbutazone and flunixin meglumine
B. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen
C. Diazepam and ketamine
D. Acyclovir and amoxicillin

Q16. What is the role of intra-articular hyaluronic acid (HA) and PSGAG in OA management?
A. HA restores viscosity and lubrication; PSGAG supports cartilage repair and matrix integrity
B. Both are purely cosmetic agents
C. They directly destroy osteophytes
D. They are used only in foals

Q17. Which intra-articular corticosteroids are commonly used and what is a key precaution?
A. Methylprednisolone and triamcinolone; strict aseptic technique and awareness that repeated use may accelerate cartilage degeneration
B. Only dexamethasone; no special precautions
C. Only prednisolone; no infection risk
D. None; corticosteroids are never used

Q18. Which systemic or biologic therapies can be adjuncts in OA management?
A. Systemic HA/PSGAG courses and autologous biologics (IRAP, PRP, ACS) to modulate inflammation and cartilage breakdown
B. Only vitamins
C. Only antibiotics
D. Only anthelmintics

Q19. Which precautions should be taken with repeated intra-articular corticosteroid use?
A. Use as frequently as possible to maintain comfort
B. Limit frequency to avoid cartilage softening and increased laminitis risk, and always use aseptic technique
C. Avoid antibiotics in joint injections
D. Never reassess the joint after injection

Q20. Which prognosis statement is MOST accurate for equine OA?
A. Mild OA in low-motion joints has a good prognosis with early management; severe OA in high-motion joints has a guarded to poor prognosis for athletic performance, though arthrodesis may restore comfort
B. All OA cases progress to complete ankylosis rapidly
C. OA has no impact on performance
D. Prognosis is always excellent regardless of severity
