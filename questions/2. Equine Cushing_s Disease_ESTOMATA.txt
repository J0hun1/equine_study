C. Primary adrenal cortical hyperplasia
D. Hypothyroid pituitary syndrome

Q2. Equine Cushing’s disease (PPID) most commonly affects:
A. Foals less than 1 year old
B. Horses between 2–5 years of age
C. Older horses, typically over 15 years of age
D. Only middle-aged draft horses

Q3. Which statement regarding the prevalence of PPID is MOST accurate?
A. It is rare in aged horses, affecting less than 1%
B. Up to about 30% of aged horses may have PPID
C. PPID occurs only in ponies, not horses
D. PPID is equally common in all age groups

Q4. Why does PPID tend to be recognized more frequently in ponies?
A. Ponies have a unique pituitary gland structure
B. Ponies tend to live longer, so age-related disease is more often observed
C. Ponies are more prone to trauma to the pituitary
D. Ponies have higher baseline ACTH in youth

Q5. The primary pathophysiologic change in PPID involves:
A. Overactivity of the pars distalis causing TSH overproduction
B. Overactivity of the pars intermedia due to loss of dopaminergic inhibition
C. Underactivity of the adrenal cortex
D. Destruction of the thyroid gland

Q6. Damage to which structure leads to enlargement and overactivity of the pituitary in PPID?
A. Optic nerve fibers
B. Peripheral sympathetic nerves
C. Hypothalamic dopaminergic neurons innervating the pars intermedia
D. Phrenic nerve branches

Q7. Excessive production of which hormone is particularly associated with PPID?
A. Thyroxine (T4)
B. Growth hormone
C. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)
D. Aldosterone

Q8. Which of the following is a common CLINICAL SIGN of equine Cushing’s disease?
A. Profound weight loss with alopecia only in white areas
B. Hirsutism, laminitis, polyuria/polydipsia, and abnormal fat deposition
C. Acute, high fever with purulent nasal discharge
D. Colic and severe diarrhea only

Q9. Hirsutism in a horse with PPID refers to:
A. Complete hair loss over the trunk
B. Failure to shed the long, curly winter hair coat appropriately
C. Patchy depigmentation of the mane and tail
D. Excessive hoof growth

Q10. Which diagnostic test can be used as a simple screening test for PPID by measuring resting hormone levels?
A. Baseline T4 test
B. Baseline ACTH test
C. Resting insulin and glucose only
D. Dexamethasone suppression test

Q11. The thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation test for PPID involves:
A. Administering TRH orally and measuring T4 levels 24 hours later
B. Administering TRH IV and comparing baseline and post-TRH ACTH levels
C. Injecting dexamethasone and measuring cortisol suppression
D. Administering insulin and measuring glucose tolerance

Q12. Why is CT imaging of the pituitary generally not used as an initial diagnostic step in PPID?
A. CT cannot visualize the equine pituitary gland
B. CT is too insensitive to detect enlargement
C. It is technically demanding, costly, and not required for most diagnoses
D. CT is contraindicated in horses with laminitis

Q13. Pergolide (Prascend®), the primary medical therapy for PPID, acts by:
A. Stimulating ACTH production to normalize cortisol
B. Acting as a synthetic dopamine agonist to restore inhibition of the pars intermedia
C. Directly destroying hyperplastic pituitary cells
D. Blocking cortisol receptors at the adrenal gland

Q14. Which is the MOST common initial side effect when starting pergolide therapy?
A. Irreversible blindness
B. Severe colic and diarrhea
C. Reversible loss of appetite (anorexia)
D. Laminitis due to drug toxicity

Q15. Which dietary recommendation is MOST appropriate for a horse with Cushing’s disease?
A. High-sugar grain to maintain weight
B. Grain with less than 10% sugar and starch, and hay tested and adjusted for low sugar/starch
C. Unlimited lush pasture access, especially in spring and fall
D. Only alfalfa cubes and molasses-based feeds

Q16. Why is grass restriction particularly recommended for horses with Cushing’s disease in spring and fall?
A. Pasture is deficient in protein during these seasons
B. Grass sugar levels are highest then, increasing laminitis risk
C. Grass lacks essential vitamins during these periods
D. Grass contains toxic alkaloids only in warm months

Q17. In managing horses with PPID, which supportive care practice is MOST appropriate?
A. Routine hoof and dental care, parasite control, and regular body clipping
B. Avoid body clipping to preserve thermoregulation
C. Minimal dental care because PPID spares oral health
D. Limiting hoof trimming to once yearly

Q18. Which statement about preventing PPID is MOST accurate?
A. PPID can be completely prevented with proper diet and exercise
B. PPID is a natural degenerative condition that cannot currently be prevented
C. PPID is caused only by environmental toxins and is fully avoidable
D. Vaccination in youth prevents PPID

Q19. What is the primary benefit of early diagnosis and treatment of PPID with pergolide?
A. Curing the disease entirely in most horses
B. Potentially slowing disease progression and improving quality of life
C. Preventing all endocrine disorders in old age
D. Eliminating the need for any hoof care

Q20. Which statement best summarizes the relationship between PPID and equine metabolic syndrome (EMS)?
A. They are the same disease process
B. They never occur together
C. Horses with PPID may also have EMS, which can complicate management
D. EMS only occurs in young horses and is unrelated to PPID
