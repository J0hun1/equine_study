B. Young to middle-aged, fit, nervous horses
C. Neonatal foals in poor condition
D. Middle-aged sedentary ponies

Q11. Which diagnostic finding is MOST consistent with ER?
A. Marked increase in CK and AST after exercise, with possible myoglobinuria
B. Persistent hyperglycemia and glycosuria
C. Radiographic evidence of bone lysis in the fetlock
D. Marked eosinophilia with pruritic skin lesions

Q12. Which test is used to detect subclinical exertional rhabdomyolysis in performance horses?
A. Resting ACTH concentration
B. Exercise challenge test with pre- and post-exercise CK measurements
C. Resting serum cortisol concentration
D. Fecal occult blood test

Q13. Which muscle biopsy or genetic test result supports a diagnosis of Type 1 PSSM in a horse with chronic ER?
A. Amylase-resistant PAS-positive glycogen on biopsy and GYS1 mutation
B. Amylase-sensitive glycogen aggregates without genetic mutation
C. Desmin-poor fibers with normal glycogen
D. RYR1 mutation with minimal glycogen change

Q14. Which immediate management step is MOST appropriate when a horse develops signs of ER during exercise?
A. Continue light exercise to “warm out” stiffness
B. Stop exercise immediately and move the horse to a well-bedded, quiet stall
C. Administer diuretics before providing fluids
D. Turn the horse out in a large paddock and observe

Q15. Which of the following is an appropriate component of ACUTE ER treatment?
A. Flunixin meglumine only if the horse is dehydrated
B. IV fluids to correct dehydration and support renal function
C. High-starch grain feeding to restore muscle glycogen quickly
D. Forced diuresis without fluid therapy

Q16. In chronic ER management, which dietary plan is MOST appropriate?
A. High-starch, low-fat diet with minimal forage
B. High-fat (> 15% DE), low-starch (< 10% DE) diet with forage at 1.5–2% body weight/day
C. Low-fat, low-fiber diet with free-choice sweet feed
D. Grazing only, no supplementation or concentration control

Q17. Which medication and timing are correctly paired for chronic ER (e.g., RER) management?
A. Phenylbutazone 4 mg/kg PO 60–90 min before exercise
B. Dantrolene 4 mg/kg PO 60–90 min before exercise to reduce Ca²⁺ release
C. Acepromazine 4 mg/kg PO 60–90 min before exercise to increase CK
D. Flunixin 4 mg/kg PO 60–90 min before exercise to induce muscle relaxation

Q18. Which measure is MOST appropriate for prevention and control of ER in susceptible horses?
A. Irregular training with long rest periods followed by intense work
B. High-starch, low-fat diet and frequent stable confinement
C. Consistent training schedule, low-starch/high-fat diet, adequate hydration, and stress reduction
D. Avoiding turnout and using high-energy concentrates to maintain fitness

Q19. Which statement about prognosis is MOST accurate for horses with ER?
A. All forms carry a grave prognosis with poor athletic outcome
B. Sporadic ER generally has an excellent prognosis with rest and gradual return to work
C. Chronic forms cannot be managed long term
D. Renal failure is never a concern in ER

Q20. Which summary statement about exertional rhabdomyolysis is MOST accurate?
A. ER is a single disease entity caused only by overexertion

C. ER is exclusively an infectious disorder of muscle
D. ER is diagnosed solely by muscle biopsy without enzyme measurements
