B. Enlarged pupil, dry eye, and blepharospasm
C. Exophthalmos, orbital swelling, and serous nasal discharge
D. No pain, only subtle vision loss

Q10. Which of the following is more characteristic of CHRONIC ERU rather than acute flare-ups?
A. Severe epiphora and corneal edema only
B. Cataracts, synechiae, retinal damage, and vitreous opacity (“snow globe” effect)
C. Only conjunctival hyperemia
D. Sudden corneal perforation with iris prolapse

Q11. A horse with ERU is at increased risk of which serious ocular complications?
A. KCS and entropion
B. Secondary glaucoma, cataracts, and eventual phthisis bulbi
C. Corneal sequestrum formation only
D. Retinal coloboma and microphthalmia from birth

Q12. Which historical or exam finding most strongly supports a diagnosis of ERU?
A. Single episode of mild conjunctivitis that resolves with topical antibiotics
B. Recurrent bouts of painful eye inflammation with periods of quiescence and progressive ocular changes
C. Chronic unilateral nasal discharge
D. Intermittent head shaking without ocular changes

Q13. Which diagnostic test can help identify an infectious trigger associated with ERU?
A. Leptospira serology or testing
B. Fecal flotation
C. Joint fluid analysis
D. Serum bile acids

Q14. Which condition is an important differential diagnosis to rule out in a horse with a painful, cloudy eye?
A. Gastric ulceration
B. Corneal ulceration
C. Colic
D. Navicular disease

Q15. What is the role of corticosteroids in the treatment of ERU?
A. They are contraindicated in all cases
B. They are used topically or systemically to reduce intraocular inflammation when no corneal ulcer is present
C. They are only given orally to treat systemic infection
D. They are replaced entirely by antibiotics

Q16. Why is atropine used in managing acute ERU flare-ups?
A. To constrict the pupil and increase aqueous outflow
B. To dilate the pupil, relieve ciliary spasm, and reduce pain
C. To directly kill Leptospira organisms
D. To increase tear production

Q17. Which NSAIDs are commonly used as part of ERU treatment?
A. Flunixin meglumine and phenylbutazone
B. Aspirin and acetaminophen
C. Ketamine and xylazine
D. Diazepam and dexamethasone

Q18. Which long-term interventional option can help reduce recurrence of ERU in some horses?
A. Corneal transplant
B. Cyclosporine implants or vitrectomy
C. Enucleation in all cases at first diagnosis
D. Simple bandage contact lens

Q19. In what situation is enucleation considered an appropriate treatment for ERU?
A. In any horse after the first mild flare
B. Only in horses with glaucoma and normal vision
C. For blind, painful eyes where vision cannot be restored
D. Never, because ERU is always reversible

Q20. Which statement BEST summarizes the prognosis of ERU?
A. With a single treatment, the disease is cured permanently
B. Early and aggressive management can preserve vision, but frequent recurrences can lead to blindness and lifelong management is often needed
C. ERU never progresses to blindness
D. ERU has no impact on long-term vision or quality of life
