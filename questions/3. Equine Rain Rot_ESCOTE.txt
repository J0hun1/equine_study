B. Biting flies, ticks, and contaminated fomites/crusts can spread infection
C. Only direct horse-to-horse contact can transmit the disease
D. It is strictly a venereal disease

Q11. In cases of truncal lesions suggestive of dermatophilosis, which condition should be considered in the differential diagnosis?
A. Dermatomyositis
B. Dermatophytosis or pemphigus foliaceus
C. Equine protozoal myeloencephalitis

Q12. When lesions are confined to the pastern region, which of the following should be ruled out?
A. Chorioptes infestation and irritant or allergic contact dermatitis
B. Gastric ulceration
C. Recurrent airway obstruction
D. Urolithiasis

Q13. When lesions are limited to white areas of the body, which differential is MOST appropriate?
A. Copper deficiency
B. Photosensitization due to liver disease or plant toxicity
C. Polysaccharide storage myopathy
D. Equine influenza

Q14. What is the general diagnostic value of CBC, biochemistry, and urinalysis in dermatophilosis?
A. Essential to confirm every case
B. Generally not of great value in diagnosis
C. Always abnormal in severe disease
D. Required to identify the organism

Q15. Which diagnostic procedure is MOST useful to confirm dermatophilosis in typical cases?
A. Skin biopsy with PAS stain only
B. Cytology of exudate and/or crust stained with modified Wright’s (Diff-Quik)
C. Fecal flotation and larval culture
D. Serum antibody titers against Dermatophilus

Q16. On cytology, Dermatophilus organisms typically appear as:
A. Large budding yeasts in chains
B. Cocci forming parallel rows within branching filaments (“railroad tracks”)
C. Acid-fast rods in clumps
D. Spirochetes with corkscrew motility

Q17. Which statement about handling crusts in a horse with dermatophilosis is MOST appropriate?
A. Crusts are not infectious and can be discarded in the stall
B. Owners should avoid removing crusts at all
C. Crusts are infectious; wear gloves, remove them gently, and dispose of them in the trash
D. Crusts should be ground into bedding to inoculate the environment

Q18. Which is an ESSENTIAL component of treatment for equine rain rot?
A. Maintaining a constantly moist environment to loosen crusts
B. Keeping the horse and its environment clean and dry, and gently removing crusts after soaking with antibacterial shampoo
C. Using high-dose systemic corticosteroids alone
D. Avoiding all bathing until lesions resolve

Q19. Which topical therapies are appropriate for focal lesions when bathing is not possible?
A. 2–4% chlorhexidine, accelerated hydrogen peroxide, or benzoyl peroxide products
B. Mineral oil and baby shampoo only
C. Lime sulfur dips only
D. Plain water rinses without any antiseptic

Q20. Which statement BEST describes the prognosis and course of equine dermatophilosis?
A. Poor prognosis with frequent scarring and chronic pain
B. Guarded prognosis; most cases progress to systemic sepsis
C. Many cases are self-limiting once environmental factors are corrected, and the prognosis is excellent
D. Disease is invariably fatal in older horses
