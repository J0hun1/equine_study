A. Only geriatrics over 20 years of age
B. Only foals under 6 months
C. Younger horses or those with compromised skin or immune function
D. Only stallions and intact males

Q7. A typical ringworm lesion in horses appears as:
A. Circular or irregular areas of alopecia with scaling, crusting, and broken hairs
B. Diffuse hyperpigmentation without hair loss
C. Deep ulcerative lesions with draining tracts
D. Vesicles and bullae along mucocutaneous junctions

Q8. Which regions are commonly involved early in equine ringworm?
A. Girth and saddle regions, with possible spread to neck, flanks, chest, and head
B. Sole and frog only
C. Perineum and ventral abdomen only
D. Eyelids and nostrils exclusively

Q9. Regarding zoonotic potential, ringworm in horses:
A. Has no zoonotic risk
B. Is zoonotic in some cases and can spread from horses to humans
C. Only spreads from humans to horses, not the reverse
D. Is only zoonotic in immunocompromised horses

Q10. Which environmental and management factor MOST increases the risk of ringworm in a stable?
A. Dry, well-ventilated stalls and individual grooming kits
B. Damp, humid conditions with shared tack and grooming tools
C. Strict isolation of new arrivals and regular disinfection
D. Daily sun exposure and open-air turnout

Q11. Which laboratory method is considered the MOST accurate for confirming dermatophytosis?
A. Bacterial culture of pus from lesions
B. Fungal culture of hairs and skin scrapings from active lesion margins
C. Serum antibody titers against dermatophytes
D. Fecal flotation and sedimentation

Q12. When collecting samples for fungal culture in suspected ringworm:
A. Lesions should be scrubbed thoroughly with alcohol before sampling
B. Sampling should focus on recently active margins, broken hairs, and crusts
C. Only intact, normal hair should be sampled
D. Only blood samples are needed

Q13. Which condition is a key differential diagnosis for equine ringworm because it can produce similar superficial skin lesions?
A. Equine protozoal myeloencephalitis
B. Dermatophilosis (rain scald)
C. Strangles
D. Equine influenza

Q14. Which topical treatment is PREFERRED as a whole-body, leave-on rinse for managing equine ringworm?
A. Dilute bleach solution applied daily
B. Lime sulfur (1:16), enilconazole (1:100), or 2% miconazole/2% chlorhexidine shampoo
C. Plain water rinses with no medicated product
D. High-concentration iodine scrub

Q15. Why are systemic oral antifungals generally avoided in treating ringworm in horses?
A. They are ineffective against dermatophytes
B. They are usually not needed and can be costly or have more side effects
C. They cause rapid recurrence of infection
D. They are only approved for use in cattle

Q16. Which advice regarding bleach use in ringworm cases is MOST appropriate?
A. Bleach is the first-line topical therapy for horses and tack
B. Bleach is avoided because it is irritating and poses human health risks
C. Bleach must be applied undiluted directly to lesions
D. Bleach is only used on wounds, not on equipment

Q17. A major complication of untreated or poorly controlled ringworm in a stable is:
A. Rapid progression to systemic mycosis
B. Widespread infection of other horses due to environmental contamination
C. Irreversible hair follicle destruction in all cases
D. Permanent scarring and hoof deformity in all horses

Q18. Which general statement about the prognosis of equine ringworm is MOST accurate?
A. Prognosis is poor even with treatment
B. Prognosis is generally good with appropriate topical therapy and hygiene
C. Prognosis is always guarded due to systemic spread
D. Prognosis is unknown because the disease is rare

Q19. Which preventive measure is MOST important to limit ringworm spread in a boarding facility?
A. Feeding high-energy diets to boost immunity
B. Avoiding clipper use during winter
C. Avoiding shared tack and grooming tools without proper cleaning and disinfection
D. Eliminating turnout time

Q20. Which statement BEST summarizes environmental control for ringworm?
A. Spores die quickly in the environment and do not require stable decontamination
B. Spores persist long term on wood, soil, and tack, so environmental cleaning is as important as treating the horse
C. Only the horse’s skin needs treatment; the stall environment is irrelevant
D. Environmental control is unnecessary once lesions are crusted
