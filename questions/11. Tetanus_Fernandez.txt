Q1. Tetanus in horses is BEST described as:
A. A viral disease causing respiratory failure
B. A bacterial infection in necrotic tissue producing a neurotoxin that causes muscular spasms
C. A fungal infection limited to the skin
D. A protozoal infection of the GI tract

Q2. Horses are considered:
A. Highly resistant to tetanus toxin
B. Among the most sensitive species to tetanus toxin
C. Not affected by tetanus
D. Only susceptible as foals

Q3. Clostridium tetani is BEST characterized as:
A. An aerobic, non-spore-forming bacillus
B. An anaerobic, Gram-positive, spore-forming bacillus with terminal spherical spores
C. A Gram-negative coccus
D. A yeast-like organism

Q4. How does C. tetani typically gain access to the horse’s body?
A. Inhalation into the lungs
B. Entry through a contaminated wound where low oxygen tension allows germination
C. Vertical transmission in utero
D. Oral ingestion and colonization of the stomach

Q5. Which condition at the wound site favors germination and proliferation of C. tetani?
A. Highly oxygenated, superficial abrasions
B. Anaerobic environment due to necrosis, foreign material, or concurrent infection
C. Dry, intact skin without contamination
D. Exposure to strong sunlight

Q6. The main neurotoxin responsible for clinical tetanus signs is:
A. Tetanolysin
B. Tetanospasmin
C. Botulinum toxin
D. Endotoxin

Q7. Tetanospasmin primarily acts by:
A. Blocking acetylcholine release at neuromuscular junctions
B. Cleaving synaptobrevin in presynaptic inhibitory interneurons, preventing release of glycine and GABA
C. Destroying myelin sheaths around motor axons
D. Increasing serotonin release in the CNS

Q8. The result of tetanospasmin action on the spinal cord is:
A. Enhanced inhibition of motor neurons and flaccid paralysis
B. Loss of motor neuron inhibition causing hypertonia and muscular spasm
C. Selective sensory neuropathy only
D. Reversible demyelination of sensory tracts

Q9. Which additional exotoxin produced by C. tetani increases local tissue necrosis?
A. Tetanolysin
B. Shiga toxin
C. Enterotoxin A
D. Lipopolysaccharide

Q10. The incubation period for tetanus in horses is usually:
A. 12–24 hours
B. 1–3 weeks, but highly variable
C. 6–12 months
D. 5–10 years

Q11. Which horses are at highest risk for tetanus?
A. Only vaccinated horses
B. Unvaccinated horses with contaminated wounds or penetrating foot injuries
C. Horses with no wounds
D. Only foals with diarrhea

Q12. Early clinical signs of tetanus in a horse may include:
A. Sudden blindness and circling only
B. Local stiffness, lameness, colic, and progression to a stiff/spastic gait
C. Severe coughing and nasal discharge
D. Isolated pruritus

Q13. Classic overt signs of tetanus include:
A. “Sawhorse stance,” raised tail head, flared nostrils, erect ears, third eyelid prolapse, and “lockjaw”
B. Hindlimb knuckling and toe dragging only
C. Severe ataxia with knuckling but no muscle tone change
D. Purely respiratory crackles

Q14. As tetanus progresses, which additional signs are commonly observed?
A. Hypothermia and bradycardia
B. Dysphagia with saliva accumulation, aspiration risk, increased temperature, profuse sweating, recumbency, extensor rigidity, difficulty urinating/defecating, and respiratory failure
C. Only mild lethargy
D. Purely GI colic with no neuromuscular signs

Q15. Which conditions are important DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSES for tetanus?
A. Laminitis, hypocalcemia, rhabdomyolysis, rabies, and myotonia
B. Only colic and gastric ulcers
C. Only navicular syndrome
D. Only equine asthma

Q16. What is the cornerstone of initial tetanus treatment in horses?
A. Corticosteroids alone
B. Neutralizing unbound toxin with tetanus antitoxin and eliminating infection at the wound, plus intensive nursing care
C. Antifungal therapy
D. Immediate surgical amputation of the affected limb

Q17. Which nursing measures are appropriate for a horse with tetanus?
A. Keeping the horse in a bright, noisy environment to maintain alertness
B. Confining to a quiet, dark stall with deep bedding, minimizing stimulation, using padded walls/helmet, and frequent turning of recumbent horses
C. Forcing the horse to exercise to prevent muscle stiffness
D. Withholding water to reduce aspiration risk

Q18. Which antimicrobial is commonly used to treat C. tetani infection?
A. Penicillin G IV for 7–10 days
B. Acyclovir
C. Fluconazole
D. Praziquantel

Q19. Why must tetanus antitoxin (TAT) and tetanus toxoid be given at different injection sites?
A. To avoid local irritation at a single site
B. Because TAT can bind and neutralize the toxoid antigen if given at the same site
C. To prevent hepatotoxicity
D. To improve vaccine absorption through multiple muscles

Q20. Which statement BEST summarizes prognosis in equine tetanus?
A. All affected horses recover fully
B. Mortality is high (50–80%); recumbent horses unable to rise have grave prognosis, whereas horses that remain standing and receive excellent nursing care may recover over weeks
C. Tetanus is always fatal within 24 hours
D. Prognosis is excellent regardless of clinical severity
