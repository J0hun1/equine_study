C. Isolated elevation of creatinine
D. Normal liver enzymes with high calcium

Q8. Which additional laboratory changes support a diagnosis of cholangiohepatitis?
A. Severe eosinophilia and hyperkalemia
B. Neutrophilia, increased fibrinogen, and elevated conjugated bilirubin, bile acids, and globulins
C. Lymphopenia and hypoglycemia only
D. Hypernatremia and hypoproteinemia

Q9. On ultrasonography, which finding is MOST suggestive of cholangiohepatitis?
A. Distended bile ducts with sludge or calculi and changes in hepatic echogenicity
B. Normal biliary tree with isolated splenomegaly
C. Free gas in the abdomen
D. Kidney enlargement without liver changes

Q10. Which diagnostic procedure can help confirm the diagnosis and guide antimicrobial therapy in cholangiohepatitis?
A. Skin biopsy
B. Needle aspirate or biopsy of liver for culture and histology
C. Fecal flotation
D. Arthrocentesis

Q11. Which combination of clinical and laboratory findings favors cholangiohepatitis over other causes of chronic colic?
A. Fever, jaundice, elevated GGT, leukocytosis, and hyperglobulinemia
B. Afebrile, normal liver enzymes, and no jaundice
C. Isolated hypoproteinemia with normal GGT
D. Normal CBC with only mild colic signs

Q12. Which differential diagnoses should be considered in horses with signs that could mimic cholangiohepatitis?
A. Chronic or recurrent colic, right dorsal displacement of the colon, neoplasia, and hepatic abscessation
B. Only gastric ulcers
C. Only laminitis
D. Only recurrent airway obstruction

Q13. What is the primary approach to medical treatment of cholangiohepatitis in horses?
A. Short-term antibiotics (3–5 days) and no follow-up
B. Long-term antimicrobial therapy (3 weeks to 6 months) guided by culture, plus NSAIDs and supportive care
C. Antifungal therapy only
D. Steroids alone without antimicrobials

Q14. Which antimicrobial regimens are commonly used in treating cholangiohepatitis?
A. Trimethoprim–sulfa, enrofloxacin, metronidazole, ceftiofur, or penicillin-based combinations
B. Only topical antibiotics
C. Antiparasitics and antifungals only
D. Macrolides in adult horses as first-line

Q15. Why should icteric horses with cholangiohepatitis be protected from sunlight?
A. To prevent dehydration
B. To reduce photosensitization due to impaired bile excretion and accumulation of photodynamic substances
C. To avoid hypothermia
D. To promote melatonin secretion

Q16. When is surgical intervention indicated in cholangiohepatitis?
A. In all horses shortly after diagnosis
B. Only if obstructing bile calculi or nonresponsive abscesses are present
C. Whenever GGT is elevated above 100 U/L
D. For cosmetic removal of scars

Q17. Which follow-up strategy is MOST appropriate after initiating therapy?
A. Discontinue antibiotics as soon as the horse seems clinically improved
B. Continue antibiotics until GGT decreases below ~100 U/L or normalizes, then recheck GGT and consider follow-up ultrasound
C. Stop treatment after 7 days regardless of bloodwork
D. No follow-up is needed if fever resolves

Q18. What is the general PROGNOSIS for cholangiohepatitis in horses?
A. Always fatal regardless of treatment
B. Good if no bile duct obstruction is present and liver echogenicity is normal
C. Poor in all cases, even with early treatment
D. Unknown because the disease is extremely rare

Q19. Which statement about very high GGT values (e.g., >2500 U/L) in cholangiohepatitis is MOST accurate?
A. They indicate inevitable liver failure and death
B. Horses may still recover with aggressive medical therapy
C. They always mandate immediate liver transplantation
D. They have no clinical significance

Q20. Which summary feature BEST characterizes cholangiohepatitis in horses?
A. Viral infection of pancreas and spleen
B. Inflammation of liver and bile ducts, most common in adult horses, often due to ascending bacterial infection, with GGT elevation as a key marker
C. Pure muscle disease without hepatic involvement
D. Primary kidney disorder with biliary obstruction
