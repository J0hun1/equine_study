B. Only the superficial digital flexor tendon
C. Only the laminae of the hoof wall
D. Only the suspensory ligament of the fetlock

Q3. Which hoof conformation is MOST commonly associated with navicular syndrome?
A. Wide, flat feet with large frogs
B. Narrow, upright feet with contracted heels and small, narrow frogs
C. Club feet with excessively long heels
D. Laminitic feet with dropped soles

Q4. How does body size relative to hoof size predispose horses to navicular syndrome?
A. Large horses with large hooves have no risk
B. Horses with small hooves and relatively large bodies concentrate high loads on small feet
C. Ponies with small bodies are most affected regardless of hoof size
D. Only miniature horses are at risk

Q5. Which management factors are considered predisposing for navicular syndrome?
A. Excellent farriery and balanced hooves
B. Poor distal limb or hoof conformation, hoof imbalance (long toes, low heels), poor hoof management, and undersized shoes
C. Lack of any work or exercise
D. Feeding high-fat diets

Q6. In warmblood breeds, navicular syndrome may have which additional component?
A. Viral etiology
B. Genetic predisposition
C. Nutritional deficiency
D. Tick-borne origin

Q7. Typical clinical presentation of navicular syndrome includes:
A. Bilateral forelimb lameness, often worse in one limb, with shortened stride, shuffling gait, and stumbling
B. Acute unilateral hindlimb paralysis
C. Diffuse muscle atrophy without lameness
D. Respiratory distress and coughing

Q8. Where is pain most commonly elicited on hoof tester examination in navicular horses?
A. Toe region only
B. Heel or frog region
C. Sole of the hind feet only
D. Coronary band only

Q9. Which diagnostic test often relieves navicular pain and reveals lameness in the opposite limb?
A. Abaxial sesamoid nerve block
B. Palmar digital nerve block
C. Peroneal nerve block
D. Infraorbital nerve block

Q10. Radiographic findings supportive of navicular syndrome may include:
A. Only normal navicular bone shape
B. Cyst-like lesions, enlarged vascular channels, medullary sclerosis, enthesiophytes, bone fragments, or flexor cortex erosions
C. Diffuse osteomyelitis of the cannon bone
D. Only laminar separation

Q11. Which advanced imaging modality provides the most detailed evaluation of all podotrochlear structures?
A. Radiography alone
B. MRI
C. CT, which is more detailed than MRI
D. Scintigraphy only

Q12. Which conservative (medical) management strategies are commonly used initially for navicular syndrome?
A. Immediate neurectomy without imaging
B. Trimming and shoeing changes, rest, and systemic NSAIDs such as phenylbutazone or firocoxib
C. High-dose corticosteroid injections in all joints
D. Stall rest only with no hoof changes

Q13. Which intrasynovial therapies can be used for navicular syndrome?
A. Intra-articular corticosteroids and biologics (e.g., into the DIP joint or navicular bursa)
B. Only intra-articular antibiotics
C. Intra-articular local anesthetic alone
D. Oral vitamins

Q14. What is the role of bisphosphonates in navicular syndrome?
A. They have no role
B. Systemic bisphosphonates (tiludronate or clodronate) can help modulate bone pain and remodeling
C. They are only used in foals with developmental disease
D. They cure the disease permanently with a single dose

Q15. Which regenerative or biologic therapies have been used in some navicular cases with soft tissue lesions?
A. Mesenchymal stem cells, autologous conditioned serum, and platelet-rich plasma
B. Only antibiotics
C. Only dewormers
D. Only antihistamines

Q16. Indications for navicular bursoscopy include:
A. Mild lameness responding to NSAIDs
B. Debridement of dorsal DDFT tears or flexor cortex erosions and removal of adhesions in the proximal navicular bursa
C. Routine exam of all sound horses
D. Sole bruising without imaging changes

Q17. Palmar digital neurectomy may be considered when:
A. Medical treatment has failed and there is no significant DDFT damage on MRI
B. At the first sign of mild heel pain
C. In foals less than 1 year old
D. To diagnose the cause of lameness

Q18. Which complications may occur after palmar digital neurectomy?
A. None; it is always curative
B. Painful neuroma formation, recurrence of lameness due to nerve regrowth, and undetected foot infection due to loss of sensation
C. Only laminitis
D. Only colic

Q19. What owner care is especially important after neurectomy?
A. No special care is needed
B. Regular foot monitoring and, often, full pad shoeing to protect the desensitized foot
C. Stopping farriery visits
D. Increased high-speed exercise

Q20. Which overall statement about prognosis for navicular syndrome is MOST accurate?
A. It is an acute disease that resolves completely with short-term treatment
B. It is a progressive degenerative condition; many horses improve with treatment but may deteriorate over time, and lifelong management is often needed
C. It never causes lameness
D. It always leads to euthanasia within one year
