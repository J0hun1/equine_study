B. Perineum, base of tail, and parotid region as black nodules under or within the skin
C. Sole of the foot and digital cushion
D. Only internal organs with no external signs

Q8. Which of the following is TRUE about the behavior of melanomas in horses?
A. They are always benign and never metastasize
B. They may remain benign but can transform to malignant forms and metastasize
C. They only occur as diffuse skin discoloration
D. They always regress spontaneously in gray horses

Q9. Which combination correctly lists systems affected by sarcoids and melanomas?
A. Sarcoids: integumentary only; Melanomas: integumentary with possible lymphatic and perineal involvement
B. Sarcoids: respiratory; Melanomas: cardiovascular
C. Sarcoids: neurologic; Melanomas: musculoskeletal
D. Both are primarily gastrointestinal diseases

Q10. Which historical finding is commonly reported by owners of horses with sarcoids or melanomas?
A. Sudden onset of high fever and respiratory distress
B. One or more firm skin masses that gradually enlarge over time
C. Acute collapse with no prior signs
D. Persistent diarrhea and weight loss only

Q11. On physical examination, sarcoids may:
A. Present as subcutaneous masses near eyelids or canthi that can become red, fleshy, ulcerated, and invasive
B. Always be flat, non-palpable macules
C. Be limited to mucous membranes only
D. Appear only as alopecic patches without mass effect

Q12. On physical examination, equine melanomas typically appear as:
A. Non-pigmented papules on the dorsal midline
B. Dark black nodules under or within the skin, often at the perineum, tail base, and parotid region
C. Vesicular lesions along the lips
D. Crusted plaques confined to the pastern region

Q13. Which diagnostic method is considered the gold standard for confirming sarcoids and melanomas?
A. Skin scraping with KOH preparation
B. Histopathologic examination of biopsy specimens
C. Fecal flotation
D. Serum antibody ELISA

Q14. What is a potential concern when performing a biopsy of a suspected sarcoid?
A. Biopsy always resolves the lesion
B. Incomplete or aggressive biopsy may worsen the sarcoid and stimulate rapid regrowth
C. Biopsy is contraindicated because sarcoids are contagious to humans
D. Biopsy has no diagnostic value

Q15. Which imaging modality is MOST useful for defining tumor margins and depth of infiltration in equine skin tumors?
A. CT only
B. Ultrasonography, with CT/MRI reserved for deeper or periocular lesions
C. Radiography only
D. Endoscopy

Q16. Which treatment is commonly used for both sarcoids and melanomas when complete margins can be obtained?
A. Oral antibiotics
B. Surgical excision
C. Topical corticosteroids alone
D. Dietary restriction

Q17. Which local therapy is particularly effective for small or superficial sarcoids and melanomas?
A. Cryotherapy (freezing)
B. Oral antifungals
C. Laser ablation of the hoof
D. UV light exposure

Q18. Which immunotherapy is used specifically for equine sarcoids and has about a 70% success rate?
A. Interferon-α injections
B. BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guérin) injections
C. Rabies vaccine
D. Tetanus toxoid

Q19. Which statement about medications for these tumors is MOST accurate?
A. Sarcoids are best treated with systemic antibiotics alone
B. Sarcoids can be managed with BCG vaccine and local chemotherapy (e.g., cisplatin), whereas melanomas rely more on surgical excision and cryotherapy
C. Melanomas respond best to antifungals and dewormers
D. No treatment is available for either tumor type

Q20. Which possible complication is of particular concern in horses with large melanomas?
A. Development of laminitis
B. Obstruction of defecation or interference with normal function due to mass effect
C. Severe pruritus and self-trauma only
D. Transformation into sarcoids
