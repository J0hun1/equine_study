Osteoarthritis

=== SLIDE 2 ===
Osteoarthritis (OA), also known as
degenerative joint disease (DJD), is a chronic,
progressive, noninfectious deterioration of
articular cartilage.
 It results in changes within the joint including
cartilage loss, subchondral bone sclerosis,
osteophyte formation, and synovial
membrane inflammation.Overview

=== SLIDE 3 ===
Signalment
Athletic Horses Repetitive training
that overwhelms
repair mechanismAll ages and both
sexes

=== SLIDE 4 ===
OA commonly develops secondary to joint
instability, trauma, or abnormal biomechanical
stress. These may result from:
Poor joint conformation or limb
deformities
Repetitive stress or excessive exercise
Previous injury to ligaments, tendons, or
cartilage
Infectious arthritis or osteochondrosis
(in young horses)Etiology / Causes of Osteoarthritis
Aging and heavy
workload are also
major predisposing
factors.

=== SLIDE 5 ===
1. Mechanical Overload
Abnormal repetitive forces (e.g., trauma, racing, jumping) exceed the normal repair
capacity of cartilage.
Results in matrix degradation, chondromalacia, and loss of viscoelastic properties.
2. Synovial Inflammation (Synovitis)
The inflamed synovium produces inflammatory mediators such as:
Prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂)
Cytokines (IL-1, TNF- α )
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and other degradative enzymes
These promote cartilage breakdown, pain, and joint effusion.
3. Loss of Synovial Fluid Quality
Inflammation reduces synovial fluid viscosity and hyaluronic acid concentration.
Leads to poor lubrication and reduced shock absorption.Pathophysiology

=== SLIDE 6 ===
4. Subchondral Bone Changes
Bone becomes sclerotic and less compliant, transmitting excessive forces to cartilage.
Remodeling creates subchondral bone sclerosis and periarticular bone proliferation.
5. Osteophyte Formation
Bone reacts to instability by forming osteophytes and enthesophytes at joint
margins.
These bony projections can fracture (chip fractures), increasing inflammation.
6. Progression Cycle
Continuous mechanical stress and inflammation perpetuate the cycle of cartilage
degeneration, synovial inflammation, and bone remodeling → chronic OA.Pathophysiology

=== SLIDE 7 ===
Signs
The hallmark of OA is articular cartilage degeneration,
occurring in a tissue devoid of innervation. Pain originates
from periarticular soft tissues or subchondral bone.

=== SLIDE 8 ===
Signs
History of intra-articular
fracture, osteochondrosis,
dislocation, or ligament injury.
Insidious lameness in low-
motion joints (distal
intertarsal, tarsometatarsal).High-motion joints
(fetlock) more likely show
acute-onset lameness.
Lameness may decrease
after rest but return with
exercise.Historical Findings

=== SLIDE 9 ===
Variable lameness: mild during
exercise, severe in advanced
stages.
Pain on flexion of affected
joint(s).
Synovial effusion—especially in
high-motion joints.Reduced range of motion; stiffness
after rest.
Chronic OA joints: palpable
thickening of the joint capsule,
hardening of periarticular tissues,
crepitus on movement
Pain and swelling localized to
affected joint.Physical Examination Findings Signs

Diagnosis
Differential Diagnosis
Septic arthritis (ruled out via synovial fluid analysis).
Osteochondrosis or joint effusion (radiography).

=== SLIDE 12 ===
Diagnosis
Imaging
Radiography:
Narrowing or loss of joint space.
Osteophyte formation or fragmentation.
Periosteal bone proliferation.
Subchondral bone sclerosis.
MRI: best for early cartilage and soft tissue changes.
Arthroscopy: direct visualization of articular cartilage and subchondral bone
lesions.
Other Laboratory Findings
 Joint fluid viscosity may be reduced.

=== SLIDE 13 ===
A i m s
Reduce joint inflammation and
pain.
Restore cartilage homeostasis
and mobility.
Delay progression of
degenerative changes.Treatment

=== SLIDE 14 ===
Management Strategies
Rest and controlled exercise: Short-term rest during acute inflammation;
gradual return to work.
Weight management: Avoid obesity to reduce joint load.
Hoof trimming and corrective shoeing: Balance limb forces and minimize
concussion.
Cold therapy: Reduces heat and swelling during acute inflammation.
Hydrotherapy or swimming: Maintains fitness while minimizing joint stress.
Physiotherapy and stretching: Preserve range of motion.
Environmental management: Soft footing in training and turnout areas.
Treatment

=== SLIDE 15 ===
1. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)
Control pain and reduce inflammation.
Phenylbutazone: 2.2 mg/kg PO q12–24h.
Flunixin meglumine: 0.5 mg/kg PO or IV q12–24h.
Caution: Avoid prolonged use in dehydrated or ulcer-prone
horses.
Medications

=== SLIDE 16 ===
2. Intra-Articular Therapy
Hyaluronic Acid (HA): Restores viscosity, lubricates joint (40 mg IV
weekly × 2–3).
Polysulfated Glycosaminoglycan (PSGAG): Stimulates cartilage repair
(500 mg IM q4d × 7 doses).
Corticosteroids:
Methylprednisolone acetate (20–60 mg/joint) — long-acting.
Triamcinolone acetate (3–18 mg/joint) — potent anti-inflammatory.
Often combined with HA for synergistic effect.
Antibiotic addition: Amikacin (125 mg) to prevent iatrogenic infection.
Medications

=== SLIDE 17 ===
3. Systemic Therapy
IV or IM HA and PSGAG courses as adjuncts to local therapy.
Autologous biologics (IRAP, PRP, ACS): Decrease cytokine-
mediated cartilage damage.
4. Nutraceuticals and Adjuncts
Chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine, omega-3 fatty acids—may
aid long-term management (evidence variable).
Topical anti-inflammatories for mild joint pain.
Medications

=== SLIDE 18 ===
Contraindications & Precautions
Avoid intra-articular corticosteroids in horses with laminitis
risk.
Strict aseptic technique during injections.
Sedate and restrain properly; bandage joint post-injection.
Repeated corticosteroid use can accelerate cartilage
degeneration.
Medications

=== SLIDE 19 ===
M o n i t o r i n g
Re-examine after treatment for pain, effusion, and lameness.
Periodic radiographs to assess progression.
“Joint flare” (sterile synovitis) after injection.
Septic arthritis if asepsis compromised.
Cartilage softening or laminitis with steroid overuse.
P r o g n o s i s
Mild OA in low-motion joints: Good prognosis with early management.
Severe OA in high-motion joints: Guarded to poor for athletic performance.
Arthrodesis (joint fusion) may restore comfort for breeding or retirement.
