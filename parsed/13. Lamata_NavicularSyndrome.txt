=== SLIDE 2 ===
Navicular 
Syndrome
Navicular syndrome is a degenerative 
disease complex of horses that can 
encompass injuries to any of the structures 
within the navicular apparatus of the foot , 
including the navicular bone, navicular 
bursa, collateral sesamoid ligaments, 
distal impar ligament, or deep digital flexor 
tendon . Certain breeds are predisposed, 
and the condition is almost always 
bilateral. Diagnosis is based on clinical 
signs and evidence from radiographic or 
advanced imaging techniques. Treatment 
is palliative and relies on corrective 
farriery , intrasynovial  medication, and 
NSAIDs. The condition is progressive, and 
the prognosis is guarded to fair.

Etiology and 
PathophysiologyHorses that have narrow, upright 
feet with contracted heels and 
small, narrow frogs are the most 
commonly affected.
Horses with small hooves may also 
have larger bodies and thus are 
predisposed to this condition 
because of the high loads 
concentrated in their small feet.

=== SLIDE 6 ===
Etiology and 
PathophysiologyPoor distal limb or hoof 
conformation, hoof imbalances 
(long toes or low heels), and poor 
hoof management or inappropriate 
shoeing (use of too small a shoe) 
are also thought to be predisposing 
factors.
In warmblood breeds, navicular 
syndrome also has a genetic 
component.

Clinical 
Findings 
and 
Diagnosis

=== SLIDE 8 ===
Commonly presents as 
bilateral forelimb lameness , 
usually worse in one limb.Lameness may be mild to 
severe, with signs like 
shortened stride , shuffling 
gait , or stumbling .Often mistaken as shoulder 
lameness by owners.Clinical Findings and Diagnosis
7Horses may show heel or 
frog pain on hoof tester 
exam and positive distal 
limb flexion.Toe wedge test may worsen 
lameness.Palmar digital nerve block 
often relieves pain, 
revealing lameness in the 
opposite limb.

Radiography helps confirm 
diagnosisCystlike  lesions
Enlarged vascular channels
Medullary sclerosis
Enthesiophytes , bone 
fragments, or flexor cortex 
erosionsSome horses show soft 
tissue injury even without 
radiographic changes.Clinical Findings and Diagnosis
8Ultrasonography can 
visualize parts of the 
navicular bursa but has 
limited diagnostic value.MRI provides the most 
detailed evaluation of all 
podotrochlear  structures.CT is useful but less 
detailed than MRI .

Navicular syndrome is a 
common cause of bilateral 
forelimb lameness in 
middle -aged horses. Many 
horses have pain in the heel 
region, which can be elicited 
by hoof testers. Most horses 
show marked improvement 
in lameness with a palmar 
digital nerve block.Many treatments are 
available. The most common 
are shoeing changes, rest, 
systemic anti -inflammatory 
drugs, and medication of 
synovial structures (distal 
interphalangeal joint or 
navicular bursa). Treatment 
is usually lifelong.Navicular syndrome is a 
degenerative condition, and 
although many horses 
respond positively to 
treatment, they may fail to 
improve with time.Summary
