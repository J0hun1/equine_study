Tyzzers DIzeaseTyzzer’s disease, caused by Clostridium piliforme, is the most
common cause of bacterial hepatitis in foals. It is confined to
foals between 7 and 42 days of age that is manifested as
rapidly progressive fatal disease with an average age of 20
days.
the foals are found acutely dead or with nonspecific
signs of enteritis and hepatitis.
Can be sporadic or occur in outbreaks
Worldwide distribution 
commonly found in the enviroment

=== SLIDE 3 ===
Causitive agenta spore-forming, gram-negative obligate anaerobe and
intracellular bacterium with a shape of filamentous rod
shaped. 
C. piliforme is motile in nature and highly pleomorphic.Clostiridium piliforme
also known as bacillus piliformis
 C piliforme is found in the feces of healthy adult horses as
well as in the environment. Foals are infected by ingesting
contaminated soil or feces.  
Transmission is through FECAL-ORAL ROUTE
Vegetative form of C. piliforme

=== SLIDE 4 ===
Clinical signs
The clinical signs are non-specific but usually manifested as
1. loss of a suckle reflex
2. depression progressing to recumbency
3. fever
4. tachypnea
5. tachycardia
6. icterus
7. petechiation
8. diarrhea
9. dehydration  
10. shock
11. seizures and coma
Sudden death with no symptoms can also happen

=== SLIDE 5 ===
Pathologic findings
C. piliforme causes acute multifocal hepatitis,
myocarditis, and enteritis.
Grossly, the liver is swollen, with 1- to 5-mm white
foci scattered throughout the parenchyma. Tissues
are icteric, and petechial hemorrhages are present in
many tis sues.
Hepatomegaly with coagulative necrosis
 surrounded by degenerate hepatocytes and
  neutrophilic(suppurative) inflammatory cell 
 migration

=== SLIDE 6 ===
Pathologic findings
In addition to hepatitis, enterocolitis,
myositis, pleural effusion, pulmonary
congestion and edema, and lymphoid
necrosis or depletion may be present.

=== SLIDE 7 ===
diagnosis
Confirmation of Tyzzer disease is achieved
 by histologic demonstration of intracellular
 interlacing bundles of filamentous bacilli
 (C.piliforme) at the periphery of the lesions
 within the liver
 Warthin-Starry or Dietrerle’s silver stainsPresumptive diagnosis maybe made on history,
physical examination, diagnostic imaging, and
clinicopathologic data.Definitive diagnosis is liver biopsy
BIOCHEMISTRY/CBC
CBC
Hemoconcentration
Hyperfibrinogenemia and normal to low leukocyte count
 Biochemistry
hypoglycemia
metabolic acidosis
Elevated serum sorbitol dehydrogenase
γ-glutamyl transferase
alkaline phosphatase
bilirubin
Coagulation profiles and imaging is also can be used.

To reduce intestinal ammonia production
Lactulose (0.1–0.25mL/kg PO every6–8h) CONTRAINDICATION 
Barbiturates
should be given with caution
for seizure management

Grave prognosis
Most foals die within 24h from the onset of
clinical signs.
