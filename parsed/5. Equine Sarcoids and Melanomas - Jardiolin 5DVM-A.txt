VET M ED 517 - EQUINE M EDICINE EQUINE SARCOIDS AND MELANOMAS

=== SLIDE 3 ===
DefinitionEquine Sarcoids are the most frequently
recognized skin tumors in horses,
representing about 40% of all equine
tumors. They are locally invasive,
fibroblastic skin neoplasms associated
with bovine papillomavirus (BPV).VET M ED 517 - EQUINE M EDICINE EQUINE SARCOIDS AND MELANOMAS

=== SLIDE 4 ===
DefinitionEquine Melanomas are dark-pigmented
skin tumors arising from melanocytes. In
horses, they may be benign or malignant.
They are particularly common in gray
horses and tend to occur under or within
the skin as black nodules.VET M ED 517 - EQUINE M EDICINE EQUINE SARCOIDS AND MELANOMAS

=== SLIDE 5 ===
PathophysiologySarcoids
Caused by bovine papillomavirus (BPV) infection transmitted by biting flies.
The virus infects dermal fibroblasts at sites of previous injury or scarring.
This leads to uncontrolled fibroblast proliferation, forming fibrous, wart-like, or
ulcerated growths.
Sarcoids are locally destructive and invasive but do not metastasize to distant organs.
Recurrence is common following incomplete removal due to residual viral-infected
cells.
VET M ED 517 - EQUINE M EDICINE EQUINE SARCOIDS AND MELANOMAS

=== SLIDE 6 ===
PathophysiologyMelanomas
Develop due to melanocyte proliferation and excessive melanin pigment formation.
Gray horses are genetically predisposed due to the gray coat color gene, which
promotes abnormal melanocyte growth.
Tumors may remain benign but can transform into malignant forms that metastasize
to internal organs such as the liver and lungs.
Lesions may enlarge and coalesce, causing obstruction or disfigurement depending
on their location.

=== SLIDE 7 ===
Systems
Affected
Sarcoids: Integumentary system (skin and
subcutaneous tissues).
Melanomas: Primarily integumentary; may
involve lymphatic, digestive, and perineal
regions when large or metastatic.VET M ED 517 - EQUINE M EDICINE

=== SLIDE 8 ===
Signalment
Sarcoids:
Commonly affect young horses
(average age 3–6 years).
No specific breed or sex
predisposition.
Frequently seen at previous injury
sites or scarring.VET M ED 517 - EQUINE M EDICINE

=== SLIDE 9 ===
Signalment
M elanom as:
Common in gray or white horses,
especially Lipizzaners, Arabians, and
Percherons.
Typically develop in older horses
(beginning around 3–4 years and
increasing with age).
Rare in non-gray horses, but when present,
they often occur in young horses (<2
years) on the trunk and legs.VET M ED 517 - EQUINE M EDICINE

=== SLIDE 10 ===
Signs
General Comments
Both tumors are slow-growing skin masses that vary
in appearance and aggressiveness depending on
their form and location.
VET MED 517 - EQUINE MEDICINE EQUINE SARCOIDS AND MELANOMAS
Historical Findings
Owners may report one or more firm skin masses
that gradually enlarge.
Sarcoids often arise after trauma or scarring.
Melanomas often develop slowly but can become
numerous over time.

=== SLIDE 11 ===
Signs
Physical Examination Findings
Sarcoids:
Appear as subcutaneous masses in eyelids or
canthi (corners of eyes).
May enlarge rapidly, becoming red, fleshy,
ulcerated, and invasive.
Occur on trunk, inner thighs, face, and periocular
areas.
Classified into occult, verrucose, nodular,
fibroblastic, mixed, and malignant types.

=== SLIDE 12 ===
Signs
Physical Examination Findings
Melanomas:
Appear as dark black nodules under or within the
skin.
Commonly located at perineum, base of tail,
parotid region, and occasionally ears.
May be solitary or multiple, forming coalescing
plaques.
Larger tumors can obstruct defecation or
interfere with normal function.
VET MED 517 - EQUINE MEDICINE EQUINE SARCOIDS AND MELANOMAS

=== SLIDE 13 ===
Causes
Sarcoids: Infection with bovine
papillomavirus (BPV) transmitted by
biting flies or via wounds.
Melanomas: Genetic predisposition
associated with the gray coat color
gene; in non-gray horses, cause is
sporadic and often congenital.VET M ED 517 - EQUNE M EDICINE

=== SLIDE 14 ===
Risk Factors
VET M ED 517 - EQUINE M EDICINE
Gray coat color (for melanomas).
Young age (for sarcoids).
Biting flies and viral exposure.
Previous skin injury or scarring.
Genetic predisposition and
immunologic factors.EQUINE SARCOIDS AND MELANOMAS

=== SLIDE 15 ===
Diagnosis
VET M ED 517 - EQUINE M EDICINE
Differential Diagnosis
Sarcoids: Papilloma, squamous cell
carcinoma, habronemiasis, fibroma,
pythiosis, or granuloma.
Melanomas: Lymphoma, sebaceous
adenoma, cyst, abscess,
hemangioma.EQUINE SARCOIDS AND MELANOMAS

=== SLIDE 18 ===
Diagnosis
Laboratory Tests
Histopathologic examination (gold
standard):
Sarcoids: Proliferation of
fibroblasts with epidermal
hyperplasia; locally invasive
pattern.
Melanomas: Dense pigmented
melanocytes within the dermis.
PCR testing for BPV DNA in sarcoid
tissues can confirm viral etiology.VET MED 517 - EQUINE MEDICINE EQUINE SARCOIDS AND MELANOMAS

=== SLIDE 19 ===
Diagnosis
Other Laboratory Tests
Fine-needle aspiration or biopsy
(diagnostic, but incomplete biopsy
may worsen sarcoids).
Cytologic examination for melanin
pigment and cell morphology.VET MED 517 - EQUINE MEDICINE EQUINE SARCOIDS AND MELANOMAS

=== SLIDE 20 ===
Diagnosis
VET M ED 517 - EQUINE M EDICINE
Imaging
Ultrasonography: Determines tumor
margins and depth of infiltration.
CT or MRI: Useful for deeper or
periocular lesions and internal
metastases.
Radiography: Assesses bone
involvement near affected regions.EQUINE SARCOIDS AND MELANOMAS

=== SLIDE 21 ===
Treatment
Surgical Excision:
Preferred for both sarcoids and melanomas if complete margins can be achieved.
Recurrence common for sarcoids if incomplete removal.
Cryotherapy (Freezing):
Effective for small or superficial sarcoids and melanomas.
Laser Surgery:
Minimizes bleeding and recurrence, especially in periocular areas.
Chemotherapy:
Local chemotherapy using cisplatin or other agents can be effective for both
tumors.VET MED 517 - EQUINE MEDICINE EQUINE SARCOIDS AND MELANOMAS

=== SLIDE 22 ===
Treatment
Radiation Therapy:
Gamma radiation (using iridium-192) highly successful for sarcoids and
melanomas that cannot be surgically removed.
Immunotherapy:
BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guérin) injections stimulate the immune response in
sarcoids with approximately 70% success rate.
Hyperthermia and Photodynamic Therapy:
Can be used as adjuncts for difficult-to-treat sarcoids.
Observation:
Small, stable melanomas may not require treatment but must be monitored.VET MED 517 - EQUINE MEDICINE EQUINE SARCOIDS AND MELANOMAS

=== SLIDE 23 ===
MedicationsDrugs of Choice
Sarcoids:
BCG vaccine (immunotherapy).
Cisplatin or 5-fluorouracil for local chemotherapy.
Radiation therapy using iridium-192 when surgery is not possible.
Melanomas:
Surgical excision or cryotherapy as mainstays.
Limited data on chemotherapeutic or radiation effectiveness.
VET M ED 517 - EQUINE M EDICINE

in pregnant mares unless
necessary.
VET M ED 517 - EQUINE M EDICINEPrecautions
