=== SLIDE 4 ===
D erm atophilosis is a com m on bacterial exudative crusting derm atitis of horses that
m ay affect m ultiple horses in a barn but not necessarily all of them . It typically occurs
during periods of heavy rain. Tightly adherent crusts m ost com m only affect the
dorsum  of the trunk, especially the saddle region or the dorsal surface of both hind
cannon bones. It is a cause of pastern derm atitis (grease heel, scratches). This
infection is easily resolved with topical and/or system ic antim icrobial therapy.Basic:
Overview

=== SLIDE 5 ===
Basic: Signalment
No age, breed, or sex predilection has been recognized. Horses that
are debilitated m ay develop a chronic infection. If a horse is kept in a
wet stall or pen, chronic pastern derm atitis m ay ensue.

Clinical SignsBasic:
Clinical Signs
6

=== SLIDE 7 ===
Clinical lesions vary
with the stage of
disease.
Initially, follicular and nonfollicular papules
and pustules form  tightly adherent crusts. 
Crusts may cluster to form
large coalescing crusted
plaques associated with a
thick yellow to light green
suppurative exudate.
Rem oval of crusts results in the distal hair ends
protruding through the crust, giving a “paint brush”
appearance. M oist, erosive, erythem atous, alopecic
lesions are present when the crust is rem oved.7

=== SLIDE 8 ===
Alopecia is variable.
If lesions are palpated, pain m ay be elicited. 
Pastern or fetlock
involvement
m ay cause lam eness and localized swelling.8

=== SLIDE 9 ===
Lymphadenopathy
may occur.9

=== SLIDE 10 ===
Basic: Causes and Risk Factors
of Equine Rain Rot
Dermatophilosis is caused by
a Gram -positive, non–acid-fast,
facultative anaerobic actinom ycete—
Dermatophilus congolensis.Skin damage and moisture
are the two m ost im portant factors
required for an infection to occur.
Skin dam age allows colonization,
while m oisture prom otes the growth
of the organism .Biting flies and ticks
m ay spread the disease, as well as
fom ites. Crusts, whether on the horse
or in the environm ent, are infectious.

2) D iagnosis
differential diagnosis; cbc/biochemistry/urinalysis;
and diagnostic procedures
11

=== SLIDE 12 ===
Diagnosis:
Differential
DiagnosisIf the lesions are truncal,
consider derm atophytosis, pem phigus foliaceus, dem odicosis,
staphylococcal folliculitis, and drug reactions.
If only pastern involvement is present, 
then staphylococcal folliculitis/furunculosis, derm atophytosis,
Chorioptes infestation, trom biculosis, irritant or allergic contact
derm atitis, photosensitization, and vasculitis need to be ruled
out.
If lesions are limited to the white areas of the body,
consider photosensitization due to liver disease, plant poisoning,
or sunburn.
12Differential d iagnoses
depend on the distribution
of the lesions.

UrinalysisGENERALLY, NOT

=== SLIDE 14 ===
diagnostic
proceduresdiagnosis:The distribution and types of lesions present are used to
establish the diagnosis.
Cytology of exudate and/or crust should be stained with a m odified
W right’s stain (Diff-Quik). Cytology collected by im pression sm ears
from  a lesion in which the crust has been rem oved, and from  the
underside of a m oist crust, is m ost rewarding.
Derm atophilus organism s appear as cocci that form  parallel rows
within branching filam ents (“railroad tracks”). Detection of the
organism  from  chronic lesions is often challenging.

3) Treatm ent
medical regimen
15

=== SLIDE 16 ===
Be cognizant of the
infectious and zoonotic
potential of the crusts.
Essential
components of
treatment include:W ear gloves when bathing the horse and
when handling the crusts. Dispose of crusts
in a trash bag; do not discard them  into the
environm ent.
1.Keeping the horse and its environm ent clean
and dry.
2.Gently rem oving the crusts after soaking with
an antibacterial sham poo.

D rug(s) of 
Choices
medications and establishing good management
practices may be all that are needed.Topical therapy
that has antimicrobial properties every 1–2
days until the lesions are healed (typically
10–14 days). Allow the shampoo a contact
time of 10–15 minutes before rinsing.Bathe the horse with a shampoo
and the lesions are focal, 2–4%
chlorhexidine, accelerated hydrogen
peroxide, benzoyl peroxide sprays,
wipes, mousses, or lotions may be used.If bathing is not possible,

=== SLIDE 26 ===
Associated Conditions
Chronic infections m ay be associated with poor
nutrition, heavy parasite infestation, viral
diseases, or neoplasia.  
In som e cases, white-haired areas are m ore
severely affected. Infection with Derm atophilus
m ay result in secondary photoderm atitis.
