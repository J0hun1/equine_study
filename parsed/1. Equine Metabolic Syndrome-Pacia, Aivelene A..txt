•Equine  metabolic  syndrome  (EMS ) is a characteristic  collection  of 
clinical  signs  and clinicopathological  changes  in equids  that 
increases  their  risk for developing  hyperinsulinemia -associated  
laminitis  (HAL), the leading  cause  of laminitis . 
•Insulin  dysregulation  (ID) is the core  component  of the syndrome .
•EMS is found  in both  horses  and ponies  and has also  been  
recognized  in donkeys . Affected  animals  typically  are obese,  with 
increased  body  condition  score  overall  and increased  regional  
adiposity  in the neck  and tailhead  regions .IntroductionVet Med 517 -Equine Medicine

•In horses,  it arises  between  the ages  of 5 and 16 years , with no 
recognized  sex predilection .
•It is most  common  in ponies  and in Saddlebreds,  Tennessee  Walking  
Horses,  Paso  Finos,  Morgans,  and Mustangs .
•It occurs  infrequently  in Thoroughbreds  and Standardbreds ; however,  
any horse  can develop  EMS.EMS  has  the  following  typical  patterns  of development  in different  
equids :

=== SLIDE 6 ===
•Equine  metabolic  syndrome  develops  because  of a disturbance  in 
the relationship  between  circulating  glucose  and insulin,  leading  to 
insulin  dysregulation .
•The specific  origin  of ID is currently  unknown  and likely  involves  the 
combination  of a diet inappropriately  high  in nonstructural  
carbohydrates  and a favorable  genetic  background  leading  to 
hyperinsulinemia  and insulin  resistance .
•Hyperinsulinemia  leads  to laminitis  in horses  and ponies,  and HAL 
represents  approximately  90% of the cases  of laminitis  in the 
general  equine  population .Etiology  and  PathogenesisVet Med 517 -Equine Medicine

=== SLIDE 7 ===
•Although  they  are two different  conditions,  pituitary  pars  
intermedia  dysfunction  (PPID)  and EMS can occur  concurrently  in 
middle -aged  and older  horses  in approximately  30% of cases .
•Therefore,  when  they  reach  the age of 12–15 years , horses  with EMS 
should  be monitored  to detect  the onset  of PPID . 
•Alternatively,  any horse  with PPID  should  be tested  for ID. It is 
important  to note  that horses  with PPID,  and not ID, rarely  develop  
laminitis ; therefore,  if a horse  with PPID  develops  laminitis,  a 
diagnosis  of ID is very  likely .Etiology  and  PathogenesisVet Med 517 -Equine Medicine

=== SLIDE 8 ===
•Horses  with EMS typically  are obese  or 
overconditioned,  with a body  condition  
score  of ≥ 7 out of 9 and a cresty  neck . 
However,  regional  adiposity  with fat 
deposition  behind  the shoulder  and the 
tailhead  are common  in horses  with EMS 
even  if generalized  obesity  is not present .
•Geldings  with EMS might  have  increased  fat 
deposition  in the prepuce ; mares  might  
have  increased  fat deposition  around  the 
mammary  glands  and show  infertility  or 
irregular  reproductive  cycles .Clinical  FindingsVet Med 517 -Equine Medicine

•Horses  with EMS that are brought  in for 
evaluation  with no known  history  of 
laminitis  often  show  evidence  of prior  
episodes,  such  as abnormal  hoof  
growth  rings  and radiographic  
evidence  of third  phalanx  rotation  or 
pedal  osteitis .Clinical  FindingsVet Med 517 -Equine Medicine

•Diagnostic  testing  for equine  metabolic  syndrome  should  focus  on 
documenting  insulin  dysregulation .
•A careful  dietary  history  and physical  examination  are essential .
•Establishing  baseline  body  condition  and neck  scoring  enables  
assessment  of the patient's  response  to treatment  for EMS.
•Because  many  factors,  including  diet, pain,  and stress,  can affect  
blood  glucose  and insulin  concentrations,  diagnostic  testing  for 
EMS should  be performed  in a controlled  manner  in a low-stress  
environment .DiagnosisVet Med 517 -Equine Medicine

=== SLIDE 11 ===
•If the baseline  insulin  concentration  is normal,  the patient's  
physiological  response  to glucose  should  be evaluated . Because  some  
horses  with EMS are normal  in all aspects  except  the ability  to handle  an 
oral carbohydrate  load .
⚬The OST is performed  by fasting  the horse  for 3–6 hours  and then  
administering  an oral dose  of corn  syrup  at 0.15–0.45 mL/kg . Blood  
should  be collected  at 60 or 90 minutes  after  administration  of the 
corn  syrup  to determine  the insulin  concentration . A concentration  ≥ 
45 mIU/mL is consistent  with ID.
⚬The OGT  is performed  by giving  a fasted  horse  0.75 g/kg  of dextrose  
powder  mixed  with chaff . An insulin  concentration  ≥ 65 mIU/mL in a 
blood  sample  collected  2 hours  later  is consistent  with ID.Oral  sugar  test  (OST)  or Oral  glucose  test  (OGT)Vet Med 517 -Equine Medicine

•Blood  insulin  concentration  ≤ 50 mIU /mL indicates  an acceptable  
response  to current  management  and a low risk of laminitis . 
•Blood  insulin  concentration  ≥ 100  mIU /mL indicates  inadequate  
management  and a high  risk of laminitis .
•Blood  insulin  concentrations  between  50 and 100  mIU /mL, the risk 
of laminitis  is unclear .
•Detection  of PPID  is important  because  PPID  is thought  to 
exacerbate  ID in horses  also affected  by EMS.DiagnosisVet Med 517 -Equine Medicine

•Diet is the most  important  element  in the management  of equine  metabolic  
syndrome,  and dietary  adjustment  is sufficient  to manage  most  cases . For all 
patients  with EMS,  whether  obese  or not, grazing,  grains,  and treats  should  be 
eliminated . 
•Hay that is low in nonstructural  carbohydrates  (10%, as determined  by feed  
analysis)  should  be provided  in a slow  feeder  or divided  into multiple  small  
meals  (ideally,  4–6) for a daily  total  of 2% of body  weight  when  the body  
condition  score  of the horse  or pony  is 5/9. 
•In obese  horses,  the daily  total  can be decreased  to 1.5% of body  weight ; 
however,  severe  restrictions  can be detrimental  and increase  the risk of 
hyperlipemia . In any case  the amount  of non-structural  carbohydrates  should  
not exceed  0.1 g/kg  per meal .TreatmentVet Med 517 -Equine Medicine

•Hoof  care  by a skilled  farrier  is essential  in all EMS cases,  even  in the 
absence  of acute  laminitis . HAL can occur  without  inducing  obvious  
lameness,  and radiography  is recommended  to detect  hoof  
distortion . In at-risk cases,  regular  hoof  trimming  every  4 weeks  by 
an experienced  farrier  is highly  recommended .
•If laminitis  has resolved,  exercise  helps  to improve  insulin  sensitivity  
by building  muscle  mass  and decreasing  fat mass . All levels  of 
exercise  are beneficial,  and 5 minutes  of walking  followed  by 15 
minutes  of brisk  trotting  followed  by 5 minutes  of walking  5 days  a 
week  improves  insulin  regulation . TreatmentVet Med 517 -Equine Medicine

•Sodium -glucose  cotransporter  2 (SGLT 2) inhibitors  have  shown  
promising  results  in managing  hyperinsulinemia . These  drugs  can 
be used  when  dietary  management  fails and in cases  of acute  
onset  of HAL.
⚬The following  SGLT 2 inhibitors,  as needed,  may  be administered  
long -term,  depending  on clinical  response :
￭velagliflozin : 0.3 mg/kg,  PO, every  24 hours
￭canagliflozin : 0.2–0.6 mg/kg,  PO, every  24 hours
￭ertugliflozin : 0.02–0.06 mg/kg,  PO, every  24 hours
￭empagliflozin : 0.02–0.06 mg/kg,  PO, every  24 hoursTreatmentVet Med 517 -Equine Medicine

•Prevention  of equine  metabolic  syndrome  should  focus  on 
providing  an adequate  diet and maintaining  normal  weight  in 
horses,  particularly  in high -risk breeds .
•Because  horses  with EMS use ingested  calories  more  efficiently  
than  other  horses,  it is imperative  to feed  patients  appropriately  to 
maintain  an ideal  condition  score  and not to use arbitrary  feeding  
guidelines .
•Particular  care  should  be exercised  when  turning  horses  on pasture  
during  times  of high -soluble  carbohydrate  content  (spring  and 
autumn) . Horses  with EMS always  require  severe  grazing  restriction .PreventionVet Med 517 -Equine Medicine

•Insulin  dysregulation  is the key problem  in cases  of equine  
metabolic  syndrome .
•High  blood  insulin  concentrations  lead  to laminitis,  which  can result  
in devastating  lameness,  loss of use, and death .
•In EMS management  and prevention,  it is important  to feed  an 
amount  that maintains  a normal  body  condition  for each  individual  
horse .
•Dietary  management  (feeding  low-carbohydrate  hay)  is important  
to prevent   laminitis .Key  points :Vet Med 517 -Equine Medicine
