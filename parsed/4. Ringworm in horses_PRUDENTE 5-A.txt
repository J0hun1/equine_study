=== SLIDE 2 ===
INTRODUCTION
Ringworm,  or dermatophytosis,  is a 
superficial  fungal  infection  affecting  the skin 
or hair (and occasionally  other  keratinised  
structures)  in horses . 
In horses  the primary  causative  fungi  are 
Trichophyton equinum  and Trichophyton mentagrophytes ; 
other  species  such as Nannizzia gypsea  (formerly  
Microsporum  gypseum ) and Microsporum canis  have also 
been  isolated .

=== SLIDE 3 ===
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Dermatophytes  feed on keratin  (hair/hair  
shafts,  superficial  skin). They colonise  the 
dead  cells of skin or hair shafts,  but 
generally  stop when  they reach  the living  
cells or inflamed  tissue . 
Transmission  can occur  via direct  contact  
with infected  animals,  or indirectly  via 
contaminated  objects  (grooming  tools,  
tack, flooring,  soil) since  spores  may lodge  
on broken  hairs  or shed  skin/hair  fragments .

=== SLIDE 4 ===
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
The fungus  often  resides  in the environment  
(soil, stall surfaces)  and gains  access  to the 
horse  when  conditions  favour  (microtrauma  
to skin, exposure,  etc.). 
Once  the infection  is present,  the host’s  
immune  response  (especially  cell‐mediated  
immunity)  will gradually  halt spread ; 
resolution  may occur  as host immunity  
builds  up.

=== SLIDE 5 ===
SIGNALMENT
SYSTEMS AFFECTED
The primary  system  involved  is the integumentary  system  
(skin,  hair, superficial  keratinised  structures) .
All ages of horses  can become  infected,  but 
younger  animals  and those  with compromised  skin 
or immune  function  tend to be at higher  risk. There  is no deep  
systemic  invasion  in 
typical  cases  of equine  
ringworm ; it remains  
superficial . 
No specific  breed  predisposition,  but management,  
exposure,  and immune  status  play a key role.

SIGNS
LESIONS COMMONLY 
AFFECTED AREAINFECTION 
CHARACTERISTICS
Lesions  typically  appear  as 
circular  or irregular  areas  of:
•Alopecia  (hair loss)
•Broken  hairs
•Scaling
•Crusting
•Mild inflammation 
(erythema)•Girth  and saddle  regions  
(“girth  itch”)
•May spread  to:
⚬Neck
⚬Flanks
⚬Chest
⚬Head•Contagious  (horse -to-horse,  
via contaminated  objects  or 
surfaces)
•Zoonotic  in some  cases  
(can spread  from horse  to 
human)

=== SLIDE 7 ===
PHYSICAL 
EXAMINATION 
FINDINGS
Circular  or irregular  areas  of hair 
loss (alopecia)  with broken,  
stubby  hairs .
Scaling  and crusting  of the skin 
within  the lesion ; sometimes  
mild erythema . 
On palpation : usually  non-
painful  or mild irritation ; often  
no deep  tissue  involvement .
The remainder  of the skin may 
appear  normal ; the lesions  are 
often  well-demarcated .
Lesions  often  appear  at the girth 
or saddle  area but can occur  
elsewhere
In group  settings,  check  other  
horses  as multiple  may be 
affected .

=== SLIDE 8 ===
CAUSES
The causative agents are dermatophyte 
fungi, especially Trichophyton equinum  and 
T. mentagrophytes  in horses. 
The fungi live in soil or are carried on hair/skin of 
animals; they can survive in the environment on 
fomites like grooming tools, tack, rugs, stalls. 
Infection is more likely when there is 
exposure plus a break in the skin barrier or 
other predisposing factors.

=== SLIDE 9 ===
RISK 
FACTORS
•Exposure  to spores  in soil, 
bedding,  blankets,  or 
grooming  tools  
•Spores  are hardy  and can 
persist  in the environment•Poor grooming or 
hygiene 
•Broken hairs, skin 
abrasions 
•Nutritional or general 
health compromise HYGIENE AND 
SKIN INTEGRITY
CONTAMINATED  
ENVIRONMENT
•Damp,  humid  
conditions  
•Prolonged  wet skin or 
sweating  under  tack ENVIRONMENTAL  
CONDITIONS
•Shared  tack, grooming  
equipment,  or stabling  
•Recently  introduced  animals  
to a groupCLOSE CONTACT 
AND GROUP 
SETTINGS
•Young  horses  with less 
developed  immunity  
•Older or 
immunocompromised 
animalsAGE AND 
IMMUNE  STATUS

=== SLIDE 10 ===
LABORATORY 
TESTS
DIAGNOSIS
Direct  microscopic  examination  
of hair or skin scale  (looking  for 
fungal  hyphae  or spores)  may 
allow  earlier  diagnosis . 
Some  laboratories  may use 
PCR assays  for dermatophyte  
DNAThe most  accurate  method  is fungal  
culture  of hairs  and skin scrapings  
from affected  areas . 
•Note : Lesions  should  not be 
wiped  with alcohol  before  
sampling,  since  it may reduce  
culture  yield. 
Sample  should  include  recently  active  margin  of lesion,  broken  hairs,  crusts,  scales  for best yield.

=== SLIDE 11 ===
DIFFERENTIAL 
DIAGNOSIS
Dermatophilosis  (rain scald) :
•Bacterial  skin infection  in horses
•May mimic  superficial  fungal  infections
Bacterial  folliculitis  / furunculosis :
•Presents  with hair loss, pustules,  or crustsAlopecia  due to non-infectious  causes :
•Physical  trauma  (e.g., tack rubs,  girth sores)
•Parasitic  infestations  (mites,  lice)
•Immune -mediated  dermatoses  (e.g., 
Pemphigus  foliaceus)
Other  skin conditions :
•Contact  dermatitis
•Allergic  reactions
•Nutritional  deficiencies  affecting  coat/skinImportant  note:
•Ringworm  may co-occur  with or be masked  by 
other  conditions
•Confirmatory  diagnostics  are helpful

=== SLIDE 12 ===
TREATMENT
Systemic  oral antifungals :
•Generally  avoided  due to high cost
Adjuvant  topical  treatments  (on non-rinse  days) :
•Enilconazole  spray  (stable  for 7 days)
•2% chlorhexidine  / 1% ketoconazole  spray
•2% chlorhexidine  / 1–2% miconazole  sprayFor lesions  near eyes:
•Use 1–2% miconazole  
vaginal  cream  daily
Avoid  bleach :
•It is irritating  and poses  a 
human  health  riskPreferred  treatment :
•Twice -weekly,  whole -body,  leave -on rinses  with:
⚬Lime  sulfur  (1:16)
⚬Enilconazole  (1:100)
⚬2% miconazole  / 2% chlorhexidine  shampoo
•Continue  until mycological  cure (negative  fungal  
culture  or PCR)

=== SLIDE 13 ===
POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS
Spread to other horses or animals:
Zoonotic transmission:
Delayed treatment risks:Risk of herd infection  due to environmental  contamination
Can spread  to humans ; important  biosecurity  concern
•More  extensive  lesions
•Longer  duration  of infection
•Increased  cost and hygiene  demands

=== SLIDE 14 ===
POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS
Secondary bacterial infections:
Hair regrowth changes:May occur  if lesions  are scratched  or traumatized
Possible  changes  in hair color  or texture  (usually  minor)
PROGNOSIS
•Generally  good  with proper  topical  
treatment  and hygiene
•Some  cases  may self-resolve  in healthy  
animals  as immunity  develops

PREVENTION AND CONTROL
INFECTION CONTROL 
IN STABLESENVIRONMENTAL 
MANAGEMENTMOVEMENT 
RESTRICTIONS
•Monitor  new arrivals
•Avoid sharing 
tack/grooming tools 
without cleaning
•Maintain stable hygiene 
(bedding, soil, wooden 
surfaces)•Spores  persist  long-term on 
wood,  soil, and tack
•Environmental 
decontamination is as 
important as treating the 
horse•Horses with ringworm may 
be excluded from 
competitions or travel until 
cleared.
•Handlers should use gloves, 
wash hands, and clean gear 
to prevent zoonotic spread.
