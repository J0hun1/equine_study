CHOLANGIOHEPATITIS
 Inflammation of the Bile Ducts and Liver Tissue
Vet Med 517-Equine Medicine

=== SLIDE 2 ===
OVERVIEW
Inflammation of both the bile ducts (cholangitis) and liver
tissue (hepatitis).
Caused by infection, obstruction, or immune-mediated
processes.
Leads to hepatic dysfunction and sometimes secondary
complications (e.g., fibrosis or bile calculi).
01

=== SLIDE 3 ===
ETIOLOGY
02Bacterial infection (ascending from intestine): Gram-negative enteric
bacteria (e.g., E. coli, Klebsiella).
Obstruction: Gallstones or bile sludge.
Immune-mediated inflammation.
Parasitic migration (e.g., liver flukes).
Secondary to:
Hepatic abscesses
Tumor necrosis
Umbilical vein infection (in foals)
Vascular compromise or hepatic lobe torsion

=== SLIDE 5 ===
CLINICAL SIGNS
04Weight loss, icterus, fever, abdominal pain, dermatitis
Severe cases: hepatic failure → encephalopathy, photosensitization
Focal abscesses: chronic colic, ill thrift

=== SLIDE 6 ===
DIAGNOSIS
05Laboratory:
↑ GGT (>300 U/L)
Mild ↑ hepatocellular enzymes (AST, SDH)
↑ conjugated bilirubin, bile acids, globulins
Neutrophilia, ↑ fibrinogen
Imaging:
Ultrasound: distended bile ducts, calculi, sludge, hepatomegaly,
fibrosis
CT (in foals) for focal abscesses

=== SLIDE 7 ===
DIAGNOSIS
06Other:
Needle aspirate or biopsy for culture and histology
Duodenal endoscopy if bile duct obstruction suspected

=== SLIDE 8 ===
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
07Conditions to rule out:
Chronic or recurrent colic
Right dorsal displacement of colon
Neoplasia
Hepatic abscessation (non-septic origin)
Key indicators favoring cholangiohepatitis:
Fever + jaundice + elevated GGT + leukocytosis + hyperglobulinemia

=== SLIDE 9 ===
TREATMENT
08 Medical Therapy:
Long-term antimicrobials (3 weeks–6 months):
Trimethoprim–sulfa (30 mg/kg q12h)
Enrofloxacin (7.5 mg/kg q24h)
Metronidazole, Ceftiofur, Penicillin
NSAIDs (flunixin meglumine) for pain/inflammation
IV fluids, pentoxifylline, DMSO for severe cases
Avoid sunlight in icteric horses

=== SLIDE 10 ===
TREATMENT
09Surgical Intervention:
For obstructing calculi or nonresponsive abscesses (rib
resection, drainage)

=== SLIDE 11 ===
FOLLOW  UP & MONITORING
10Continue antibiotics until GGT <100 U/L or normal.
Recheck GGT post-treatment.
Follow-up ultrasound to assess hepatic healing or residual
abscesses.

=== SLIDE 12 ===
PROGNOSIS
11Good prognosis if no bile duct obstruction and liver
echogenicity is normal.
Horses with GGT >2500 U/L can recover with medical therapy.
Poor prognosis in fibrotic or chronic cases.

=== SLIDE 13 ===
Aspect Description
Definition Inflammation of liver & bile ducts
Common in Adult horses
Main Cause Ascending bacterial infection
Key Diagnostic Marker GGT elevation
Treatment Long-term antibiotics, NSAIDs
Prognosis Good if treated earlySUMMARY
