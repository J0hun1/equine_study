=== SLIDE 3 ===
A syndrome of muscle fatigue, pain, and cramping linked to
exercise.
Results from disruption of muscle energy metabolism or
calcium regulation.
Characterized by skeletal muscle necrosis and elevated CK/AST
enzymes.
Leads to leakage of enzymes and myoglobin from muscle cells.
Clinical range: from mild stiffness to severe myoglobinuric renal
failure.
Affects horses across all breeds and athletic disciplines.OVERVIEWVet Med 517 | Equine Medicine

=== SLIDE 4 ===
Primary Mechanism:
Disturbance in muscle energy metabolism or calcium regulation.
Leads to sustained muscle contraction, metabolic exhaustion,
and cell damage.
Cellular Events:
1. Overexertion or metabolic defect → reduced ATP availability.
2. Impaired calcium reuptake → persistent contraction (rigidity).
3. Muscle fiber necrosis → release of CK, AST, LDH, and
myoglobin.
In Chronic Forms:
Genetic mutations cause ongoing metabolic dysfunctionPATHOGENESISVet Med 517 | Equine Medicine

ER CLASSIFICATION
A. Sporadic Exertional Rhabdomyolysis
Single or infrequent episodes after overexertion or poor conditioning.
Triggered by diet imbalance, illness, or environmental stress.
B. Chronic Exertional Rhabdomyolysis
Recurrent episodes associated with inherited or metabolic muscle
disorders:
Type 1 & 2 Polysaccharide Storage Myopathy (PSSM1 & PSSM2)
Myofibrillar Myopathy (MFM)
Malignant Hyperthermia (MH)
Recurrent Exertional Rhabdomyolysis (RER)
Vet Med 517 | Equine Medicine

=== SLIDE 6 ===
SPORADIC ER
Overexertion beyond level of training.
Electrolyte and mineral deficiency: Na, Ca:P imbalance, vitamin E or Se deficiency.
Concurrent respiratory disease or systemic stress.
High temperature and humidity.
Dehydration or insufficient warm-up.
CHRONIC ER
Genetic mutations:
GYS1 → Type 1 PSSM.
RYR1 → Malignant Hyperthermia.
Metabolic defects: abnormal glycogen storage or calcium flux.
Behavioral: nervous temperament, stress during confinement.
Dietary: high-starch / low-fat feeds.
Training errors: inconsistent exercise, long rest periods before work.
CAUSES & RISK FACTORS

=== SLIDE 7 ===
All breeds susceptible, but certain predispositions:
Quarter Horses, Drafts, Morgans → Type 1 PSSM
Warmbloods, Arabians, Thoroughbreds → Type 2 PSSM / MFM
Quarter Horses → Malignant Hyperthermia (RYR1 mutation)
Thoroughbreds & Standardbreds → Recurrent ER (RER)
Common in young to middle-aged, fit, nervous horses.SIGNALMENTVet Med 517 | Equine Medicine

Begin during or soon after exercise.
Excessive sweating, muscle
fasciculations, stiffness.
Painful, firm gluteal and lumbar
muscles.
Reluctance or refusal to move.
Tachycardia, tachypnea, and distress.
Severe cases → recumbency and dark
coffee-colored urine (myoglobinuria).
CLINICAL SIGNS
Vet Med 517 | Equine Medicine

=== SLIDE 10 ===
DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis based on history , clinical signs, and enzyme elevation .
CK and AST markedly increased after exercise.
Severity correlates with degree of enzyme rise.
Subclinical cases detected by exercise challenge test (CK measured
pre- and post-work).
CBC: normal or mild hemoconcentration.
Biochemistry:
↑ CK (early), ↑ AST  (persistent), possible ↑ LDH.
Severe cases → azotemia from renal compromise.
Urinalysis : myoglobinuria , high specific gravity , possible proteinuria.
Imaging: ultrasound may show muscle edema; not routinely required.

=== SLIDE 11 ===
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSISMuscle Biopsy:
Type 1 PSSM → amylase-resistant PAS-positive glycogen.
Type 2 PSSM → amylase-sensitive glycogen aggregates.
MFM → desmin protein aggregates in fibers.
Genetic Tests: identify GYS1 or RYR1 mutations.
Helps determine dietary and exercise management plans.
Colic: Sweating and pain but no muscle rigidity.
Laminitis: Reluctance to move but no muscle swelling.
Infectious Myositis: Fever, elevated WBCs, inflammatory response.
Neurologic disorders: Ataxia without muscle soreness.

=== SLIDE 12 ===
Stop exercise immediately.
Move to a well-bedded, quiet stall with access to water.
Relieve pain and anxiety:
Acepromazine 0.02–0.05 mg/kg IV/IM.
Xylazine ± Butorphanol 0.2–0.4 mg/kg IV.
NSAIDs (Flunixin 1.1 mg/kg IV q12h) if well hydrated.
IV Fluids: correct dehydration and support renal function.
Avoid diuretics unless under IV fluid therapy.TREATMENTVet Med 517 | Equine Medicine

=== SLIDE 13 ===
Diet:
High-fat (> 15% DE), low-starch (< 10% DE).
Forage 1.5–2% body weight/day.
Add vitamin E, selenium, cysteine-rich amino acids.
Medications:
Dantrolene 4 mg/kg PO 60–90 min before exercise → reduces Ca² ⁺
release.
Phenytoin 1.4–2.7 mg/kg PO q12h → stabilizes muscle excitability.
Exercise: consistent daily turnout; gradual conditioning.TREATMENT

=== SLIDE 14 ===
PREVENTION & CONTROL
Maintain consistent training schedule and avoid long rest
periods.
Ensure adequate hydration and electrolyte balance.
Use low-starch, high-fat diets; avoid sudden feed changes.
Reduce stress and excitement: quiet housing, calm handling.
Regular monitoring of CK/AST in susceptible horses.
Avoid breeding carriers of GYS1 or RYR1 mutations.Vet Med 517 | Equine Medicine

=== SLIDE 15 ===
Sporadic form: excellent prognosis with rest and gradual return
to training.
Chronic forms: lifelong management required, but performance
often maintained.
Complications: renal failure from myoglobinuria → guarded
prognosis.
Response to therapy improves when enzyme normalization guides
training resumption.PROGNOSISVet Med 517 | Equine Medicine

=== SLIDE 16 ===
ER is a group of exertional muscle disorders, not a single disease.
Divided into sporadic (environmental/management) and chronic
(genetic/metabolic).
Diagnosis: enzyme elevation (CK, AST), myoglobinuria, and genetic or
biopsy confirmation.
Treatment: relieve pain, restore fluids, prevent renal injury.
Drugs of choice: Dantrolene and Phenytoin for recurrent forms.
Prevention: consistent exercise, proper diet, stress reduction.
Outcome: generally good with early recognition and careful management.KEY TAKEAWAYSVet Med 517 | Equine Medicine
