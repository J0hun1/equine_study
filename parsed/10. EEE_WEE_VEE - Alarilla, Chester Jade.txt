Eastern (EEE), Western (WEE), 
and Venezuelan (VEE) Equine 
Encephalitides 
Category:  Equine Neurologic Viral Diseases 
Agents:  EEEV, WEEV, VEEV (Family: 
Togaviridae , Genus: Alphavirus )

=== SLIDE 2 ===
I. Introduction 
●Arboviral encephalomyelitis  affecting horses and humans. 
○Occur in North and South America .
●Transmitted from sylvatic reservoirs  to horses and humans via mosquitoes .
●South American EEEV variant now designated as Maradiaga Virus (MDV) .

=== SLIDE 3 ===
II. ETIOLOGY 
●EEEV, WEEV, VEEV:  Single-stranded, 
enveloped, positive-sense RNA viruses. 
○Family:  Togaviridae 
○Genus:  Alphavirus 
●Reservoirs: 
○Birds → EEEV 
○Rodents → Endemic VEEV 
●In epizootic VEEV, mutations occur causing 
equids to become reservoirs.

an Alphavirus  derived by cryoelectron

=== SLIDE 4 ===
III. Pathophysiology 
●Causes destructive encephalomyelitis  from neuronal viral replication .
●Leads to severe inflammation  with polymorphonuclear infiltration. 
○EEEV : Most neurovirulent, causing rapid neuronal damage. 
○WEEV : Milder disease; Highlands J variant  persists in Florida. 
○VEEV : Unique— horses act as amplifying hosts  during outbreaks.

=== SLIDE 5 ===
IV. Epidemiology 
●Endemic to North & South America. 
○Outbreaks fluctuate with weather and mosquito populations. 
●Expanding northward (USA & Canada). 
○EEEV:  Eastern USA. 
○WEEV:  Western USA. 
○VEEV:  Southern Texas, Central & South America.

=== SLIDE 6 ===
V. Signalment 
●No breed or sex predisposition .
●Young horses  more at risk for 
EEE. 
●Risk Factors: 
○Poor vaccination coverage. 
○High mosquito density. 
○Undervaccinated horses 
entering endemic regions. 
A foal (young horse) with its mare (adult female 
horse). Young horses  are more susceptible to 
Eastern Equine Encephalomyelitis (EEE) .

=== SLIDE 7 ===
VI. Clinical Signs (Early/Prodromal Stage) 
●During the early (prodromal) stage , occurring 48–96 hours  before 
neurologic signs, horses may show: 
○Fever; 
○Depression; 
○and inappetence 
●Some may also exhibit mild lameness  or abdominal discomfort  prior to the 
onset of neurologic disease.

=== SLIDE 8 ===
VI. Clinical Signs (Neurologic Stage) 
●Shows signs of diffuse brain involvement , such as: 
○Somnolence  (drowsiness) 
○Dementia  (mental dullness) 
○Head pressing , ataxia  (incoordination) , blindness , circling , and seizures 
●May involve the spinal cord or brainstem , causing weakness  or paralysis .
●Severe cases  progress to colic-like signs , reduced alertness , recumbency , and 
death .
●Other possible signs:  abortion , mouth sores , lung bleeding , and nosebleed .

=== SLIDE 9 ===
VII. Diagnosis 
Serology 
●IgM capture ELISA  titer ≥400 → confirmatory .
●Fourfold rise  in titer between acute and convalescent samples → positive .
●EEEV:WEEV titer ratio  ≥4 = suspicious ; ≥8 = strongly indicative  of EEEV 
infection. 
●EEE-affected horses rarely survive long enough for paired sampling. 
Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) 
●Neutrophilic pleocytosis  (increased neutrophils) .
●Elevated total protein  concentration.

=== SLIDE 10 ===
VIII. Differential Diagnosis 
●West Nile Virus (WNV) encephalomyelitis  — tends to cause milder cerebral 
and more spinal cord signs. 
●Rabies  — consider with acute neurologic signs and behavioral changes. 
●Leukoencephalomalacia  — due to moldy corn ingestion. 
●Hepatic encephalopathy  — associated with liver dysfunction.

=== SLIDE 11 ===
VIII. Pathologic Findings 
●Gross: 
○Congested meninges. 
○Petechial hemorrhages of brain/spinal cord. 
○Cerebral edema with possible herniation of brain tissue. 
●Histologic: 
○Meningoencephalomyelitis with neuronal degeneration and gliosis. 
○Perivascular and neuroparenchymal infiltrates. 
○Possible cardiac lesions.

=== SLIDE 12 ===
IX. Treatment 
●Supportive care only : No specific antiviral therapy is available .
●Fluid and metabolic support : Maintain hydration and correct metabolic 
imbalances. 
●Prevent self-induced trauma : Take precautions to avoid injuries caused by 
neurologic deficits. 
●Corticosteroids : May provide benefit in mild cases ( anecdotal evidence ).

=== SLIDE 13 ===
X. Prognosis 
●EEEV:  85–100%  mortality. 
●WEEV:  20–40%  mortality. 
●VEEV:  40–80%  mortality. 
○Survivors may retain neurologic deficits ( ataxia , depression , behavioral 
changes ).
●Reinfection possible ; vaccination recommended.

=== SLIDE 14 ===
XI. Prevention and Control 
●Vaccination:  Essential preventive measure. 
●Vector Control:  Reduce mosquito exposure. 
●Reporting:  Notify health authorities of cases. 
●Use PPE during outbreaks, especially with VEEV.

=== SLIDE 15 ===
XI. Zoonotic Potential 
●EEEV & WEEV : Horses are dead-end hosts ; they do not transmit the virus to 
humans. 
●VEEV : Horses can act as active amplifiers , posing a risk of transmission to 
humans  during epizootics. 
Biosecurity Measures 
●Avoid contact with blood, ocular, or nasal secretions from infected horses. 
●Follow strict rabies necropsy protocols  when handling carcasses. 
●Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)  during treatment, handling, 
or necropsy.

=== SLIDE 16 ===
XII. Key Takeaways 
●Equine arboviral infections primarily affect the central nervous system  and 
have high fatality rates .
●EEEV  is the most virulent , while VEEV  poses a significant zoonotic risk .
●Prevention  relies on vaccination  and mosquito/vector control .
●Early detection, prompt supportive care, and timely reporting  are critical to 
saving lives and controlling outbreaks.
