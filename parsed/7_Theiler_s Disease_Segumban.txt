Follow-up

=== SLIDE 3 ===
BasicsThe clinical disease is characterized by fulminant hepatic failure
and encephalopathy in adult horses.
Has been reported in horses for nearly 100 years, but the exact
cause remains unknown.
It is considered to be one of the most common causes of acute
hepatic failure. 
The disease typically occurs in individual horses, but outbreaks of
multiple horses have occurred.
THEILER’S DISEASEOVERVIEW

=== SLIDE 4 ===
There are 3 separate epidemiologic diseases with identical clinical,
clinicopathologic, and pathologic findings.
01
02
03
Acute, often
fulminant hepatitis
in horses that have
received equine-
origin blood products
approximately 4–10
weeks earlier and less
severe to subclinical
disease in other
horses receiving the
same product Acute, sometimes
fulminant hepatitis
occurring in a horse
that was in contact
with a blood product-
inoculated Theiler
disease horse, but that
did not itself receive
the equine-origin
blood productAcute, fulminant
hepatitis in horses
(often broodmares on
pasture in the fall) with
no known equine-
origin blood product
administration. This
last syndrome can
occur as farm
outbreaks.
BasicsOVERVIEW

=== SLIDE 5 ===
BasicsAdult horses, particularly
those with a history of
receiving equine-origin
serum (especially tetanus
antitoxin) or plasma
approximately 4–10 weeks
earlier. 
May also be horses without a
recent history of equine
blood product administration
(nonbiologic origin acute
hepatitis). SIGNALMENT

=== SLIDE 6 ===
Sudden in onset and rapidly
progressive, with death occurring 2–6
days later
Icteric (jaundice) and pass dark urine
(bilirubinuria)
Signs of hepatic encephalopathy
(acute blindness and aimless
wandering around the stall or paddock)
Frequent yawning
Neurologic signs (mild to severe
depression or coma, to maniacal
behavior or seizures)
Hemolysis and hemoglobinuria (poor
prognostic indicators)
Photosensitivity and abdominal pain
BasicsSIGNS

=== SLIDE 7 ===
Most commonly
associated with
administration of an
equine-origin blood
product 4–10 weeks before
the onset of signs. Some
epidemiologic evidence
suggests that some cases
may result from an
infectious agent
BasicsCAUSES AND RISK FACTORS
Viruses that establish chronic/persistent
infection in horses and their possible
association with liver disease: 
NPHV (also called equine hepacivirus
[EHCV]),
TDAV/Theiler disease-associated virus
EPgV/Equine pegivirus (Flaviviridae, genus
Hepacivirus) 
EqPV-H/Equine parvovirus (Parvoviridae,
genus unclassified)

=== SLIDE 8 ===
Acute onset of icterus in adult horses has multiple causes:
Prehepatic—red maple or wild onion toxicity, equine infectious
anemia, and immune-mediated hemolytic anemia poisoning
Hepatic—anorexia, Theiler disease, Clostridium novyi, bacterial
cholangiohepatitis, hepatotoxicity
Posthepatic—cholelithiasis and other causes of biliary obstruction
Signs of HE can be very similar to those of several acute neurologic
diseases—rabies, Eastern equine encephalomyelitis, Western equine
encephalitis, and acute protozoal myeloencephalitis. 
Hematuria, hemoglobinuria, myoglobinuria, and bilirubinuria may
cause pigmenturiaDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

DiagnosisCBC/BIOCHEMISTRY
/URINALYSISOTHER LAB TESTS IMAGING OTHER DIAGNOSTIC
PROCEDURES
CBC (usually normal, some have thrombocytopenia associated with DIC)
Biochemistry (acute, severe liver disease)
Marked increase in aspartate aminotransferase (often nearly 2000 IU/L; >4000 IU/L
seems to be associated with a poor prognosis)
Marked elevations in SDH and GLDH
Moderate increases in biliary-derived enzymes (GGT usually increased to 100–300 IU/L)
Both conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin are increased 
Increased anion gap
Mild hyperglycemia, rarely hypoglycemia
Urinalysis—bilirubinuria and hemoglobinuria (latter is a poor prognostic indicator)

/URINALYSISOTHER LAB TESTS IMAGING OTHER DIAGNOSTIC
PROCEDURES
Liver biopsy is
not indicated in
horses with
“classic” signs of
Theiler disease
as histologic
data will likely
not change
therapy.

=== SLIDE 14 ===
PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS
Diagnosis
The liver is almost always smaller
than normal.
Histologically, affected livers
show severe centrilobular or
massive liver necrosis/apoptosis
with portal areas less severely
affected but with a mononuclear
cell infiltration and slight to
moderate bile duct proliferation,
with or without fibrosis.
Vasculitis has occasionally been
reported.
Alzheimer type II astrocytes are
present in the brain in virtually
all of the cases

=== SLIDE 15 ===
PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS
Diagnosis
Normal equine liver Enlarged, flaccid, and dark reddish-brown
to purple, with a soft, easily deformable
texture, resembling a “dish rag.” Normal liver (on the left) is firm, smooth,
and has a consistent reddish-brown color,
while the affected liver (on the right) is
pale, mottled, and friable

=== SLIDE 16 ===
Provide supportive care including IV fluids, nutritional support, and
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antibiotic therapiesGOALS OF THERAPY
Treatment
Restrict activity,
and avoid
sunlight
House the horse
in a quiet place,
preferably
padded to
prevent injuryFluid therapy
Hypertonic
saline (7.5%, 4
mL/kg) or
balanced
isotonic
crystalloid fluid
Continue at the
maintenance
rate (not eating
and drinking)
Multiple B
vitamins

=== SLIDE 17 ===
Provide supportive care including IV fluids, nutritional support, and
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antibiotic therapiesGOALS OF THERAPY
Treatment
Nutritional support
Highly palatable
grass hay (fed 1.5%
of body weight per
day), along with
small amounts of
high glycemic feeds
at <1.0 g/kg/day
should be offered in
4–6 meals per day
(sorghum or soaked
beet pulp)

=== SLIDE 18 ===
To decrease GI-derived neurotoxins
(predominantly ammonia), decrease
cerebral edema, correct glucose,
electrolyte, and acid–base abnormalities,
and maintain perfusion and oxygenation
to the brain and other vital organs. 
All sedation should be avoided;
however, to prevent injury, detomidine
(5–10 μ g/kg IV) can be used. 
If more long-term sedation is required,
gabapentin (5–12 mg/kg PO every 12 h)
or pregabalin (2–4 mg/kg PO every 12
h) could be considered. 
Conversely, in horses with profound
coma, sarmazenil (0.04 mg/kg IV) or
flumazenil (0.01–0.02 mg/kg IV) may be
useful GABA receptor antagonistsDRUGS OF CHOICE
Medications

=== SLIDE 19 ===
DRUGS OF CHOICE
Medications
Metronidazole (15 mg/kg PO every 12 h),
Neomycin (10–20 mg/kg PO every 8 h)
and/or lactulose (0.3–0.5 mL/kg PO or per
rectum every 8 h) may help reduce
ammonia production and absorption from
the GI tract 
Anti-inflammatory treatment—
pentoxifylline (7.5 mg/kg PO or IV
(compounded) every 8–12 h) to reduce
systemic inflammation 
Antimicrobial therapy—bactericidal
antibiotic (e.g. ceftiofur) to prevent
bacterial translocation from GI tract to
blood
Antioxidant therapy—acetylcysteine by
slow IV administration (up to 100 mg/kg)
diluted in 5% dextrose. S-adenosyl
methionine (10–15 mg/kg PO) to provide
antioxidant effect

=== SLIDE 20 ===
Neomycin should not be given for more than 24–36 h; it may
induce severe diarrhea
Avoid overly sedating horses with HE, as excessive lowering
of the head in the standing horse may induce cerebral
edema
Ideally, all oral medications should be given by dose syringe
rather than nasogastric tube as nasal bleeding resulting
from passage of a stomach tube can result in ingestion of
considerable amounts of blood protein, which would likely
increase blood ammonia production
Because the liver metabolizes many drugs, their duration of
action may be increased in acute hepatic disease
CONTRAINDICATIONS/POSSIBLE
INTERACTIONS
Medications

=== SLIDE 21 ===
Monitor liver
enzymes and
bilirubin every 2–3
days. Maintain
adequate serum
potassium levels
to reduce
hyperammonemia.PATIENT
MONITORING
Follow-up
Severe HE has a poor prognosis
Those who continue to eat for 3
days and have supportive
treatments may fully recover
Decline in serum SDH and GLDH
after 2–3 days of treatment,
along with concurrent
improvement in clinical signs,
suggests a favorable prognosis

consequences in horses that
recoverEXPECTED COURSE
