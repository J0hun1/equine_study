OVERVIEW
Equine  Cushing's  Disease  or Pituitary  
pars  intermedia  dysfunction  (PPID)  is a 
condition  of older  horses  and typically  
develops  in horses  over  15 years  of age,  
although  it can develop  in younger  animals . 
Up to 30% of aged  horses  have  the 
condition,  and the risk of developing  the 
disease  increases  directly  with  age,  such  
that  most  horses  in their  late 20s and 30’s 
will have  the condition . The disease  tends  to 
be seen  more  commonly  in ponies  but this 
may  be because  ponies  tend  to live longer  
rather  than  because  ponies  are at greater  
risk of the disease .

=== SLIDE 3 ===
WHAT CAN CAUSE PPID?
The condition  is due to overactivity  of one 
part  of the pituitary  gland,  resulting  in the 
excessive  release  of certain  metabolically  
active  proteins  and hormones . The pituitary  
gland  is located  beneath  the brain  and  
releases  its products  in response  to signals  
from  nerves  that  originate  in another  area  
of the brain . Damage  to these  nerves  
causes  the pituitary  to enlarge  and produce  
excessive  quantities  of substances,  
including  hormones,  such  as 
adrenocorticotropic  hormone  (ACTH) . The 
disease  progresses  gradually  as the nerves  
to the pituitary  slowly  degenerate .

CLINICAL SIGNS
•Laminitis
•Hirsutism
•Abnormal  fat deposition  and 
insulin  resistance
•Increased  drinking  and urination
•Increased  sweating
•Lethargy
•Seizures,  weakness,  blindness,  
and collapse
•Infertility
•Infectious  disease

DIAGNOSIS
BASELINE ACTH TEST
TRH STIMULATION TESTA simple  blood  test that  measures  a horse's  
resting  ACTH  levels  to screen  for the 
condition,  with  higher -than -normal  levels  
indicating  the disease
Also a blood  test, but it requires  two blood  draws : a 
baseline  sample  and a second  sample  taken  after  a 
hormone  called  thyrotropin  is given  to your  horse  
intravenously . The second  blood  sample  is collected  10 
minutes  after  the thyrotropin  injection . Both  samples  will 
then  be sent  to the lab to compare  the ACTH  levels  in each .

DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING
CT SCAN 
Can  be used  to visualize  and measure  an 
enlarged  pituitary  gland,  which  is a 
common  feature  of PPID,  though  they  are 
not typically  used  for initial  diagnosis .

=== SLIDE 7 ===
TREATMENT
DAILY MEDICATION
Prascend®  (pergolide) . 
•Acts  like a synthetic  dopamine,  which  improves  
the regulation  of the pars  intermedia’s  production  
of ACTH .
•Stimulates  receptors  in the brain  and thereby  
replaces  the activity  of the damaged  nerve  
supply  to the pituitary  gland . This results  in a 
reduction  of hormone  production  to normal  levels . 
•The most  common  side effect  is reversible  loss of 
appetite  when  treatment  is started . Some  horses  
may  need  to be started  on Prascend®  gradually,  
as it can cause  a decreased  appetite .

=== SLIDE 8 ===
WHAT NOT TO FEED A HORSE 
WITH CUSHING’S DISEASE
•Horses  with Cushing’s  disease  should  usually  not 
be fed any diet high  in sugar . Grain  should  contain  
less than  10% sugar  and starch,  and your  horse’s  
hay may  need  to be analyzed . If the hay sugar  and 
starch  level  analysis  comes  back  high,  their  forage  
will need  to be changed  or hay must  be soaked .
•Restricting  grass  intake  is also recommended,  
especially  in the spring  and fall when  the sugar  in 
grass  is at the highest  level .

=== SLIDE 9 ===
MANAGING OTHER SYMPTOMS OF 
EQUINE CUSHING’S SYNDROME
•Maintaining  an ideal  body  weight
•Routine  hoof  care
•Routine  dental  care  
•Routine  parasite  control
•Regular  body  clipping

=== SLIDE 10 ===
PREVENTION AND CONTROL 
•PPID  is a natural  degenerative  condition,  
and therefore,  there  is nothing  that can 
be done  to prevent  it. Early  treatment  with 
pergolide  may  slow  the progression  of 
the disease,  but this is unproven . 
•Good  management , there  is no reason  
why horses  with PPID  cannot  live a long  
and normal  life and continue  in normal  
work .

=== SLIDE 11 ===
KEY TAKEAWAYS
•Cushing’s  disease  is a progressive  disorder  in horses  that affects  the 
pituitary  gland .
•Cushing’s  in horses  ultimately  causes  the adrenal  glands  to produce  
more  cortisol .
•Horses  with Cushing’s  disease  may  have  underlying  conditions  such  
as equine  metabolic  syndrome .
•Treatment  for Cushing’s  disease  in horses  is an FDA-approved  tablet  
called  Prascend®  (pergolide) .
