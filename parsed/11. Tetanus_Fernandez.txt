INTRODUCTION
Tetanus is a bacterial infection that is caused by a specific
neurotoxin produced by Clostridium tetani in necrotic
tissue. Horses seem to be the most sensitive of all species.
In general, the occurrence of C tetani in the soil, especially
in cultivated soil, and the incidence of tetanus in horses is
higher in the warmer parts of the various continents.

=== SLIDE 4 ===
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
anaerobe, Gram-positive, spore-forming bacillus.
terminal, spherical spores are widespread in the environment, particularly
in soil and mammalian feces as well as intestinal tractsCLOSTRIDIUM TETANI
gains access to the animal via a contaminated wound
The oxygen tension within the wound must be low to
allow germination.
Concurrent infection with other bacteria, foreign bodies or
necrosis in wound help produce an anaerobic tissue
environment.
C. tetani organisms proliferate locally.MODE OF ENTRY

=== SLIDE 5 ===
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Death/lysis of organisms → release tetanospasmin (main neurotoxin)TOXIN PRODUCTION
Tetanospasmin travels to the CNS via the hemolymphatic
system and peripheral motor nerves.
The toxin acts on presynaptic inhibitory interneurons in the
ventral horn of the spinal cord.
It cleaves synaptobrevin, a protein necessary for release of
the neurotransmitters glycine and γ -aminobutyric acid.
This results in a loss of motor neuron inhibition,
hypertonia and muscular spasm.ACTION OF TETANOSPASMIN

=== SLIDE 6 ===
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
2 OTHER EXOTOXINS OF CLOSTRIDIUM TETANI
Tetanolysin - increase local tissue necrosis and promotes
proliferation within the wound.
Non-spasmogenic toxin - have a sympathomimetic effect.
INCUBATION PERIOD
highly variable, but it is usually 1–3 weeks.
The spores can survive in tissue and germinate
after wound healing if conditions then become
favorable.
Castration wounds and injection sites have also
been associated with the development of tetanus

=== SLIDE 7 ===
SYSTEMS AFFECTED
Neuromuscular 
The toxin causes spasmodic, tonic contractions of the voluntary muscles and paralysis
Respiratory
Skeletal
The spasms may be severe enough to cause bone fracturesSpasms affecting the larynx, diaphragm, and intercostal muscles lead to respiratory failure

=== SLIDE 8 ===
INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE
Horses are exquisitely sensitive to the toxin, and the disease has a worldwide distribution.
A higher incidence may be associated with poor husbandry.
There may be a higher incidence in warmer areas.
SIGNALMENT/GENETICS
No sex, age, or breed predilections. Genes are also not involved. 
RISK FACTORS
Unvaccinated horses that have sustained a contaminated soft tissue
wound or penetrating wound to the foot are most at risk. Tetanus may
occur even in vaccinated horses.

=== SLIDE 9 ===
History of a wound 1–4 weeks earlier.
The first signs may be local stiffness, lameness, colic.
The progression of signs depends on the extent of infection,
vaccination status, and the age and size of the horse.
Generally, signs progress within 24 hours, with the horse
beginning to exhibit a stiff/spastic gait.
CLINICAL SIGNS

=== SLIDE 10 ===
CLINICAL SIGNS
Trembling, raised tail-head, flared nostrils, and
erect ears are seen.
Preferential effects on postural muscles result in
the characteristic “sawhorse stance.”
Retraction of the eyes and protrusion of the
third eyelid occur following a stimulus (noise or
menace).
Spasm of the masseter muscles causes inability
to open the mouth (“lockjaw”)

CLINICAL SIGNS
PROLAPSE OF
THIRD EYELID 
LOCKJAW
SAW HORSE STANCE

=== SLIDE 13 ===
CLINICAL SIGNS
Dysphagia results in saliva accumulation and aspiration
of feed material.
Increased rectal temperature and profuse sweating
occur due to prolonged muscle spasms.
All signs are exacerbated by stimulation and excitement.
As the disease progresses:
Recumbency with difficulty or inability to rise.
Severe extensor rigidity may occur.
Horses may have difficulty urinating and defecating.
Respiratory failure occurs in fulminant (severe) cases.

=== SLIDE 14 ===
DIAGNOSIS
Laminitis 
Hypocalcemia 
Rhabdomyolysis
Rabies
MyotoniaDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
CBC/BIOCHEMISTRY/URINALYSIS
Nonspecific
Hemoconcentration and a stress leukogram may be
present.
May see hyperfibrinogenemia and leukocytosis with
secondary aspiration pneumonia

=== SLIDE 15 ===
DIAGNOSIS
Anaerobic culture of C. tetani may be attempted
from a wound OTHER LABORATORY TESTS 
IMAGING
No specific diagnostic indications
Thoracic radiography or ultrasonography if
aspiration pneumonia is suspected.
Ultrasonography of wound sites may help
confirm anaerobic infection.
PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS
Nonspecific.
May demonstrate a C. tetani–infected wound.
Secondary traumatic injury or aspiration
pneumonia may be present.

=== SLIDE 16 ===
TREATMENT
APPROPRIATE HEALTHCARE
Initial treatment is aimed at neutralizing unbound toxin and preventing further
release by eliminating the infection.
Appropriate nursing care, particularly if the horse is recumbent, is vital to
maximize the chances of a successful outcome.
Fluid therapy may be required to maintain hydration.
Nasogastric fluids have the added benefit of hydrating colonic contents;
however,
IV or rectal administration of fluids may be necessary in horses where a
nasogastric tube cannot be maintained.

=== SLIDE 17 ===
TREATMENT
NURSING CARE
Confine to a quiet, dark stall with deep bedding.
Minimize auditory stimulation with ear plugs.
Use padded walls and/or a padded helmet to
minimize injury.
Frequently turn recumbent horses (every 2–4 hours).
Recumbent horses unable to rise may benefit from
slinging.
Manual rectal evacuation and/or urinary
catheterization may be necessary.

=== SLIDE 18 ===
TREATMENT
ACTIVITY
Restrict activity as much as possible through confinement and sedation.
DIET
High-quality feed and free-choice water should be made easily accessible.
If the horse is dysphagic, a nasogastric tube can be placed for administration of
feed, water, and electrolytes.
The tube can be left in place to avoid the stress of repeated passage.
In some cases, passage of a nasogastric tube is not possible, and feeding via
esophagostomy, gastrostomy, or parenteral nutrition may be required.

=== SLIDE 19 ===
TREATMENT
CLIENT EDUCATION
Appropriate tetanus prophylaxis should be discussed.
SURGICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Debride the wound and maximize exposure to air
Esophagostomy or gastrostomy may facilitate feeding in severely dysphagic
cases.
Tracheostomy may be necessary if laryngeal spasm and respiratory obstruction
have occurred.

=== SLIDE 20 ===
Tetanus antitoxin — 100–200 U/kg IV or IM (single dose) to
bind circulating toxin.
Acepromazine — 0.05–0.08 mg/kg IV or IM every 3–6 hours
as required.
Phenobarbital — 6–12 mg/kg slow IV, followed by 6–12
mg/kg PO every 12 hours, alone or in combination with
acepromazine.
Penicillin G (potassium or sodium) — 22,000–44,000 IU/kg
IV every 6 hours for 7–10 days.
DRUGS OF CHOICEMEDICATIONS

=== SLIDE 21 ===
Consider intrathecal administration of 50 mL TAT (20–30 mL in
foals) after removal of an equal amount of cerebrospinal fluid
from the atlanto-occipital space (requires general anesthesia)
or via lumbosacral puncture in the standing horse. (Most
beneficial early in the disease process.)
Local infiltration of the wound with procaine penicillin and/or
tetanus antitoxin (3,000–9,000 IU) may help eliminate infection
and neutralize toxin present at the site.
Vaccination with tetanus toxoid — clinical disease does not
result in sufficient immune response.
Use a separate injection site for the antitoxin.
DRUGS OF CHOICEMEDICATIONS

=== SLIDE 22 ===
PRECAUTIONS
 POSSIBLE INTERACTIONS MEDICATIONS
TAT has been associated with the development of Theiler’s
disease (serum hepatitis).
General anesthesia and intrathecal TAT administration can result
in significant complications (meningitis, seizures).
TAT will bind tetanus toxoid — these agents should be
administered at different sites.
Phenothiazine drugs (e.g., acepromazine) may
potentiate barbiturates, causing more profound CNS
depression if used together.

=== SLIDE 23 ===
ALTERNATIVE DRUGS
Magnesium (MgSO₄) administered via IV constant rate infusion
induces muscle relaxation, and reduces the requirement for other
muscle relaxants and sedatives in human tetanus patients.
Monitoring of serum Mg levels and ECG for signs of toxicity
(widening of the QRS complex) is recommended during therapy.
Haloperidol — 0.01 mg/kg IM every 7 days for long-acting sedation.
Diazepam — 0.01–0.4 mg/kg IV every 2–4 hours.
Macrolides (in foals only), tetracyclines, and metronidazole
      are alternatives to penicillin that may also be effective
      in eliminating vegetative C. tetani at the 
      infection site.MEDICATIONS

=== SLIDE 24 ===
PATIENT MONITORING
Regular physical examination.
Serial monitoring of packed cell volume (PCV), total
protein concentration, and/or urine specific gravity to
monitor hydration.
 PREVENTION/AVOIDANCE FOLLOW-UP
Initial vaccination with 2 doses of tetanus toxoid given 3–4
weeks apart.
Annual toxoid booster thereafter is the current
recommendation (although new evidence suggests
horses may have protective antibody titers for at least 3
years after the initial vaccine course).
Tetanus toxoid should be administered in the case of a
wound if there has not been vaccination within the past 6
months.

=== SLIDE 25 ===
PREVENTION/AVOIDANCE
POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONSFOLLOW-UP
Pregnant mares should be given a toxoid booster 4–6
weeks prior to expected parturition.
Experimental studies indicate that immunity to tetanus
challenge is present 8 days after administration of toxoid
in horses.
Myopathy
Aspiration pneumonia
Trauma (fractures, decubital ulcers)
Idiopathic acute hepatic disease (Theiler’s disease) is a
rare complication of TAT administration

=== SLIDE 26 ===
EXPECTED COURSE AND PROGNOSIS FOLLOW UP
Horses that are recumbent and unable to rise have a
grave prognosis, particularly if progression has been
rapid.
The presence of dyspnea and dysphagia may also
negatively influence survival.
Horses that retain the ability to stand and ambulate
have a fair prognosis.

=== SLIDE 27 ===
EXPECTED COURSE AND PROGNOSIS FOLLOW UP
Clinical signs may persist for weeks; however, survivors 
       generally stabilize after 7 days and begin to show
       improvement after 2 weeks.
Recovery may take as long as 6 weeks but is usually complete.
The attitude of the individual horse and the ability to provide 
       ideal nursing care are important factors affecting outcome.
The overall mortality rate in horses is reported to be 50–80%.
